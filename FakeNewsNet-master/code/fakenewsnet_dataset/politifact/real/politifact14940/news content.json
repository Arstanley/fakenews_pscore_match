Jeff Flake, who delivered a speech to the Senate on Jan. 17, 2018.\n\nMr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident...\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nAs the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history.\n\nIt is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last.\n\n2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth -- more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader.\n\nThis alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.\n\nI dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of U.S. based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice.\n\nAccording to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges.\n\nMr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship -- and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality.\n\nNo politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.\n\nOf course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t.\n\nNo longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame -- is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger.\n\nNow, we are told via twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are.\n\nAnd so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism.\n\nTogether, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth -- and not partners in its destruction.\n\nIt is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural.\n\nBut many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation.\n\nTo be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.\n\nIgnoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country.\n\nMr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated.\n\nMr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports.\n\nBut a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story:\n\n\u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d\n\nIn the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d\n\nIn July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call 'fake news' today, isn't it?\u201d\n\nThere are more:\n\n\u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group.\n\nLeaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d\n\nAnd on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible.\n\nWe are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere.\n\nIn our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster. As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d\n\nAny of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it.\n\nWhat is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question:\n\n\u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d\n\nMr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world -- made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions.\n\nWe are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing -- these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.\n\nI sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \"What is truth?\" His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows:\n\n\u201cThen say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,\n\nFor the limits of time it steps o'er.\n\nTho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst.\n\nTruth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,\n\nEternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d\n\nThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201801/319/1155968404_5713627373001_5713606670001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"], "top_img": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201801/319/1155968404_5713627373001_5713606670001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Louis Nelson", "Darren Samuelsohn", "Politico Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/17/full-text-jeff-flake-on-trump-speech-transcript-343246", "title": "Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcript", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "og": {"title": "Full text: Jeff Flake on Trump speech transcript", "description": "Sen.
