Democrats had been filibustering to prevent the confirmation of three conservative judicial nominees named by President Bush.\n\nMcCain said he took pride in his votes to confirm Supreme Court Justices John Roberts and Samuel Alito, a line that drew applause from assembled members of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Arizona senator also seemed to move past his usual \u201csecure the borders first\u201d mantra in favor of calling for, as he put it, \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform.\"\n\nLast summer, McCain and Sen. Edward Kennedy led the charge on an immigration reform package that aroused the ire of conservatives and ultimately threatened to undermine McCain's then-frontrunning presidential bid. (McCain also supported immigration reform bills in 2005 and 2006.)\n\n\u201cUnless we enact comprehensive immigration reform I don\u2019t think you can take it piecemeal,\u201d he explained Monday, answering a question about providing visas for skilled workers.\n\n\u201cIn other words,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause as soon you and I start to talk about the highly skilled workers, our agricultural interest people are going to say, \u2018Look we need ag workers, too.\u2019 And then somebody\u2019s going say, 'We need the DREAM Act,' and then somebody\u2019s going to say, 'We\u2019ve got to enforce our border.'\u201d\n\nThroughout the Republican primary battle last fall, McCain faced relentless questions about his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, the 2007 bill that would have allowed illegal immigrants to remain in the United States if they faced certain penalties. Opponents labeled it \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nSince clinching the nomination, McCain has largely avoided speaking about wide-ranging immigration reform, arguing primarily that the government needs to focus on securing the border with Mexico before taking on other measures.\n\nOn Monday, he lobbied for a broader approach that includes a temporary guest worker program and tamper-proof ID cards.\n\n\u201cWe get in this kind of a circular firing squad on immigration reform in the Congress of the United States,\" McCain said, \"and the lesson I learned from it is we\u2019ve got to have comprehensive immigration reform.\u201d", "images": ["http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130812114259-crossfire-logo-carousel-search-tease.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130718155918-tiny-white-house-search-tease.jpg", "http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png?m=1354137473h", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/ac360/home.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/111026112447-capitol-dome-search-tease.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/right_rail/grey_corner_TL.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/1px.gif", "http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/politicalTicker.jpg", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/130611141805-obama-search-tease.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/05/05/art.mccain.monday.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/baseplate/corner_wire_BL.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/images/1.gif", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/global/icons/btn_close.gif", "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/111013021633-voting-stickers-generic-search-tease.jpg", "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/2.0/mosaic/base_skins/right_rail/grey_corner_BL.gif", "https://cnnpoliticalticker.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/mug-hamby.jpg?w=30"], "top_img": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/politicalTicker.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Posted By"], "canonical_link": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/05/05/mccain-touts-gang-of-14-immigration-reform/", "title": "McCain touts 'Gang of 14,' immigration reform", "meta_data": {"title": "McCain touts", "description": "[cnn-photo-caption image= http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/05/05/art.mccain.monday.jpg caption=\"John McCain touted his stance on immigration Monday\"] CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (CNN) -- John McCain the presidential candidate suddenly sounded like the John McCain of 2005 on Monday, touting two...", "keywords": "john mccain, cnn political producer peter hamby", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s1.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "og": {"title": "McCain touts 'Gang of 14,' immigration reform", "url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/05/05/mccain-touts-gang-of-14-immigration-reform/", "type": "article", "description": "[cnn-photo-caption image= http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/05/05/art.mccain.monday.jpg caption=\"John McCain touted his stance on immigration Monday\"]\r\nCHARLOTTE, North Carolina (CNN) -- John McCain the presidential candidate suddenly sounded like the John McCain of 2005 on Monday, touting two...", "image": "http://i.cdn.turner.com/cnn/.element/img/3.0/sect/blogs/fb/politicalTicker.jpg"}, "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1209916800.0, "source": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
