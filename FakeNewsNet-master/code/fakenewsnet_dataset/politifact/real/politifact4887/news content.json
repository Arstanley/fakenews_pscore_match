There\u2019s no question. They\u2019re not in some lesser standard.\u2019\u2019\n\nGalvin pointed out that, in 1997, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that \u201cthe governor is not explicitly included\u2019\u2019 in the Public Records Law. He said that means that e-mails don\u2019t have to be released to the public, but the governor\u2019s office still has to preserve them and turn them over to the state archivist.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t sell things to people who work for me,\u2019\u2019 said Galvin, a Democrat. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people getting their chair or something as a gift. But generally if you work for me you don\u2019t take your laptop with you when you leave.\u2019\u2019\n\nSecretary of State William F. Galvin, who oversees the state Public Records Law, said it appeared odd that state property - in this case, hard drives - was essentially being sold to private individuals.\n\nShe accused Patrick of \u201cdoing the Obama campaign\u2019s dirty work\u2019\u2019 and called it one in a series of \u201cpolitical attacks to distract from Obama\u2019s horrible record on jobs.\u2019\u2019 Patrick, a Democrat, is a close friend and supporter of President Obama, and is expected to play a prominent role in his reelection campaign.\n\n\u201cIn leaving office, the governor\u2019s staff complied with the law and longtime executive branch practice,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cSome employees exercised the option to purchase computer equipment when they left. They did so openly with personal checks.\u2019\u2019\n\nAndrea Saul, a spokeswoman for the Romney campaign, said the governor\u2019s aides did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s office has found no e-mails from 2002-2006 in our possession,\u2019\u2019 Reilly said in a statement. \u201cBefore the current administration took office, the computers used during that time period were replaced and the server used during that time period was taken out of service, all files were removed from it, and it was also replaced.\u2019\u2019\n\nAs a result, Patrick\u2019s office, which has been bombarded with inquiries for records from the Romney era, has no electronic record of any Romney administration e-mails, Reilly said.\n\nRomney administration officials had the remaining computers in the governor\u2019s office replaced just before Governor Deval Patrick\u2019s staff showed up to take power in January 2007, according to Mark Reilly, Patrick\u2019s chief legal counsel.\n\nJust before Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor\u2019s office and first ran for president, 11 of his top aides purchased their state-issued computer hard drives, and the Romney administration\u2019s e-mails were all wiped from a server, according to interviews and records obtained by the Globe.\n\nJust before leaving office, Romney\u2019s staff went before the Records Conservation Board, which is made up of appointees from various state agencies and reviews public record retention. In some cases, the Romney administration was given permission to destroy records, Galvin said, oftentimes because they were redundant.\n\n\u201cI know that all of the Romney materials were dealt with by the public records board,\u2019\u2019 Galvin said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that what was portrayed to the records board was a complete and accurate summary. I don\u2019t know that.\u2019\u2019\n\nMark Nielsen, who was Romney\u2019s chief legal counsel, bought his hard drive on Dec. 12, 2006, just over two weeks before Patrick administration officials took over the governor\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThe longstanding practice in the governor\u2019s office was to give employees the option to buy old equipment when they were leaving office, and certain employees, including me, did that,\u2019\u2019 Nielsen told the Globe. \u201cBut those purchases were in conformance with the law and with longstanding executive branch practice.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that we complied with the letter and the spirit of the law,\u2019\u2019 he added. When asked why he would want to purchase his hard drive, he said, \u201cEmployees were given that option and it was my understanding that it was a longstanding practice in the governor\u2019s office.\u2019\u2019\n\nWhen asked about replacing the remaining computers and wiping the server clean, he said, \u201cAll I can tell you is we fully complied with the law and complied with longstanding executive branch practice. Nothing unusual was done.\u2019\u2019\n\nPam Wilmot, executive director of Common Cause Massachusetts, said Romney administration officials may not have violated the letter of the state Public Records Law, but may have run afoul of its spirit.\n\n\u201cInformation that was generated in the administration belongs to the people of the Commonwealth, unless it was personal in nature,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u201cThere is a place for purchasing of surplus property, but there are procedures to do that. And it seems that we are, as a Commonwealth, losing something if all records were deleted.\u2019\u2019\n\nAll told, 11 Romney administration officials bought 17 hard drives from the governor\u2019s office, paying $65 for each one, according to copies of canceled checks that they wrote and members of the current administration. Many of the aides wrote \u201cequipment\u2019\u2019 or \u201chard drives\u2019\u2019 in the memo space on their checks.\n\nBeth E. Myers, who was Romney\u2019s chief of staff, bought her hard drive on Aug. 18, 2006, the same month that she left state employment.\n\nShe later became Romney\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nPeter G. Flaherty, who was Romney\u2019s deputy chief of staff, bought the hard drive from his computer on Nov. 3, 2006, four days before Patrick was elected, defeating his Republican opponent, Kerry Healey, who was Romney\u2019s lieutenant governor. Flaherty later became the Romney campaign\u2019s chief liaison to social conservatives.\n\nThe rest of the hard drives were bought in November and December of 2006 by other aides.\n\nWhile Patrick aides said they do not have any electronic records of Romney administration e-mails, Galvin said there are 700 to 800 boxes of paper records from the Romney era at the state archives in Boston.\n\nIn 2009, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston was embroiled in controversy after one of his top aides, Michael J. Kineavy, acknowledged that he had deleted nearly every e-mail he sent or received over the previous five years.\n\nThe law requires municipal employees to preserve e-mails for at least two years, even if they have \u201cno informational or evidential value,\u2019\u2019 and provides for penalties of up to a year in jail.\n\nA nine-month investigation by Attorney General Martha Coakley\u2019s office concluded, however, that the destruction of the e-mails was not a crime because Kineavy was not willfully attempting to hide the correspondence from the public.\n\nLevenson can be reached at mlevenson@globe.com.
