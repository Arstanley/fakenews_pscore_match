Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used.\n\nAP: I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.\n\nTRUMP: Good.\n\nAP: I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview.\n\nTRUMP: Did you see Aya (Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years) ...\n\nAP: Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?\n\nTRUMP: No, just \u2014 you know, I asked the government to let her out. ...\n\nTRUMP: You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.\n\nAP: How did you hear about this story?\n\nTRUMP: Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It\u2019s an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize \u2014 I mean, she was in a rough place.\n\nAP: Did you have to strike a deal with (Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah) el-Sissi over this?\n\nTRUMP: No. No deal. He was here. He \u2014 I said, \u201cI really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out.\u201d And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ...\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, it\u2019s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel.\n\n(Crosstalk) AP: Really?\n\nTRUMP: Chancellor Merkel.\n\nTRUMP: And I guess somebody shouted out, \u201cShake her hand, shake her hand,\u201d you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.\n\nAP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?\n\nTRUMP: No. Because, um, I\u2019m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I\u2019m at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. ...\n\nTRUMP: So it was a great thing to see that happen.\n\n___\n\nAP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?\n\nTRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, it\u2019s an artificial barrier. It\u2019s not very meaningful. I think I\u2019ve established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I\u2019m here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I\u2019ve established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they\u2019ve never seen anything like what\u2019s going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ...\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019ve developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody\u2019s written that. In fact, they said, \u201cOh, well, he\u2019s not treating them nicely,\u201d because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, \u201cCome on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.\u201d He\u2019ll pay.\n\nAP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting?\n\nTRUMP: He\u2019s going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it\u2019s a different kind of a presidency.\n\nAP: Do you feel like that\u2019s one thing that you\u2019ve changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,\u201d or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ...\n\nTRUMP: I saved $725 million on the 90 planes. Just 90. Now there are 3,000 planes that are going to be ordered. On 90 planes I saved $725 million. It\u2019s actually a little bit more than that, but it\u2019s $725 million. Gen. Mattis, who had to sign the deal when it came to his office, said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this in my life.\u201d We went from a company that wanted more money for the planes to a company that cut. And the reason they cut \u2014 same planes, same everything \u2014 was because of me. I mean, because that\u2019s what I do.\n\nTRUMP: Now if you multiply that times 3,000 planes, you know this is on 90 planes. In fact, when the Prime Minister (Shinzo) Abe of Japan came in because they bought a certain number of those ... The first thing he said to me, because it was right at the time I did it, he said, \u201cCould I thank you?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat?\u201d He said, \u201cYou saved us $100 million.\u201d Because they got a $100 million savings on the 10 or 12 planes that they (bought). Nobody wrote that story. Now you know that\u2019s a saving of billions and billions of dollars, many billions of dollars over the course of \u2014 it\u2019s between 2,500 and 3,000 planes will be the final order. But this was only 90 of those 2,500 planes.\n\nAP: And you expect those savings to carry out across that full order?\n\nTRUMP: More. I\u2019m gonna get more than that. This was a thing that was out of control and now it\u2019s great. And the woman that runs Lockheed, Marillyn (Hewson), she was great. But all of a sudden it was a different kind of a thing. You know?\n\n___\n\nAP: Do you feel like you\u2019ve been able to apply that kind of a relationship to your dealings with Congress as well?\n\nTRUMP: I have great relationships with Congress. I think we\u2019re doing very well and I think we have a great foundation for future things. We\u2019re going to be applying, I shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but we\u2019re going to be announcing, probably on Wednesday, tax reform. And it\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019ve worked on it long and hard. And you\u2019ve got to understand, I\u2019ve only been here now 93 days, 92 days. President Obama took 17 months to do Obamacare. I\u2019ve been here 92 days but I\u2019ve only been working on the health care, you know I had to get like a little bit of grounding right? Health care started after 30 day(s), so I\u2019ve been working on health care for 60 days. ...You know, we\u2019re very close. And it\u2019s a great plan, you know, we have to get it approved.\n\nAP: Is it this deal that\u2019s between the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus, is that the deal you\u2019re looking at?\n\nTRUMP: So the Republican Party has various groups, all great people. They\u2019re great people. But some are moderate, some are very conservative. The Democrats don\u2019t seem to have that nearly as much. You know the Democrats have, they don\u2019t have that. The Republicans do have that. And I think it\u2019s fine. But you know there\u2019s a pretty vast area in there. And I have a great relationship with all of them. Now, we have government not closing. I think we\u2019ll be in great shape on that. It\u2019s going very well. Obviously, that takes precedent.\n\nAP: That takes precedent over health care? For next week?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, sure. Next week. Because the hundred days is just an artificial barrier. The press keeps talking about the hundred days. But we\u2019ve done a lot. You have a list of things. I don\u2019t have to read it.\n\n___\n\nAP: You did put out though, as a candidate, you put out a 100-day plan. Do you feel like you should be held accountable to that plan?\n\nTRUMP: Somebody, yeah, somebody put out the concept of a hundred-day plan. But yeah. Well, I\u2019m mostly there on most items. Go over the items, and I\u2019ll talk to you ...\n\n(Crosstalk.)\n\nTRUMP: But things change. There has to be flexibility. Let me give you an example. President Xi, we have a, like, a really great relationship. For me to call him a currency manipulator and then say, \u201cBy the way, I\u2019d like you to solve the North Korean problem,\u201d doesn\u2019t work. So you have to have a certain flexibility, Number One. Number Two, from the time I took office till now, you know, it\u2019s a very exact thing. It\u2019s not like generalities. Do you want a Coke or anything?\n\nAP: I\u2019m OK, thank you. No. ...\n\nTRUMP: But President Xi, from the time I took office, he has not, they have not been currency manipulators. Because there\u2019s a certain respect because he knew I would do something or whatever. But more importantly than him not being a currency manipulator the bigger picture, bigger than even currency manipulation, if he\u2019s helping us with North Korea, with nuclear and all of the things that go along with it, who would call, what am I going to do, say, \u201cBy the way, would you help us with North Korea? And also, you\u2019re a currency manipulator.\u201d It doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: And the media, some of them get it, in all fairness. But you know some of them either don\u2019t get it, in which case they\u2019re very stupid people, or they just don\u2019t want to say it. You know because of a couple of them said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t call them a currency manipulator.\u201d Well, for two reasons. Number One, he\u2019s not, since my time. You know, very specific formula. You would think it\u2019s like generalities, it\u2019s not. They have \u2014 they\u2019ve actually \u2014 their currency\u2019s gone up. So it\u2019s a very, very specific formula. And I said, \u201cHow badly have they been,\u201d ... they said, \u201cSince you got to office they have not manipulated their currency.\u201d That\u2019s Number One, but much more important, they are working with us on North Korea. Now maybe that\u2019ll work out or maybe it won\u2019t. Can you imagine? ...\n\nAP: So in terms of the 100-day plan that you did put out during the campaign, do you feel, though, that people should hold you accountable to this in terms of judging success?\n\nTRUMP: No, because much of the foundation\u2019s been laid. Things came up. I\u2019ll give you an example. I didn\u2019t put Supreme Court judge on the 100 (day) plan, and I got a Supreme Court judge.\n\nAP: I think it\u2019s on there.\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know. ...\n\nAP: \u201cBegin the process of selecting.\u201d You actually exceeded on this one. This says, \u201cBegin the process of selecting a replacement.\u201d\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s the biggest thing I\u2019ve done.\n\nAP: Do you consider that your biggest success?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I \u2014 first of all I think he\u2019s a great man. I think he will be a great, great justice of the Supreme Court. I have always heard that the selection and the affirmation of a Supreme Court judge is the biggest thing a president can do. Don\u2019t forget, he could be there for 40 years. ... He\u2019s a young man. I\u2019ve always heard that that\u2019s the biggest thing. Now, I would say that defense is the biggest thing. You know, to be honest, there are a number of things. But I\u2019ve always heard that the highest calling is the nomination of a Supreme Court justice. I\u2019ve done one in my first 70 days.\n\nTRUMP: Our military is so proud. They were not proud at all. They had their heads down. Now they have their heads up. ...\n\nTRUMP: I\u2019m rebuilding the military. We have great people. We have great things in place. We have tremendous borders. I mention the F-35 because if I can save $725 million \u2014 look at that, that\u2019s a massive amount of money. And I\u2019ll save more as we make more planes. If I can save that on a small number of planes \u2014 Gen. (Jim) Mattis (the defense secretary) said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d because he had to sign the ultimate (unintelligible) ... He had to sign the ultimate, you know. He said, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this before, as long as I\u2019ve been in the military.\u201d You know, that kind of cutting.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: Now, if I can do that (unintelligible) ... As an example, the aircraft carriers, billions of dollars, the Gerald Ford, billions and billions over budget. That won\u2019t happen.\n\nAP: Is that something you\u2019re going to take on?\n\nTRUMP: (unintelligible) But as we order the other ones, because they want to order 12, the other ones are going to come in much less expensive. ...\n\n___\n\nAP: Can I ask you, over your first 100 days \u2014 you\u2019re not quite there yet \u2014 how do you feel like the office has changed you?\n\nTRUMP: Well the one thing I would say \u2014 and I say this to people \u2014 I never realized how big it was. Everything\u2019s so (unintelligible) like, you know the orders are so massive. I was talking to \u2014\n\nAP: You mean the responsibility of it, or do you mean \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Number One, there\u2019s great responsibility. When it came time to, as an example, send out the 59 missiles, the Tomahawks in Syria. I\u2019m saying to myself, \u201cYou know, this is more than just like, 79 (sic) missiles. This is death that\u2019s involved,\u201d because people could have been killed. This is risk that\u2019s involved, because if the missile goes off and goes in a city or goes in a civilian area \u2014 you know, the boats were hundreds of miles away \u2014 and if this missile goes off and lands in the middle of a town or a hamlet .... every decision is much harder than you\u2019d normally make. (unintelligible) ... This is involving death and life and so many things. ... So it\u2019s far more responsibility. (unintelligible) ....The financial cost of everything is so massive, every agency. This is thousands of times bigger, the United States, than the biggest company in the world. The second-largest company in the world is the Defense Department. The third-largest company in the world is Social Security. The fourth-largest \u2014 you know, you go down the list.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP. It\u2019s massive. And every agency is, like, bigger than any company. So you know, I really just see the bigness of it all, but also the responsibility. And the human responsibility. You know, the human life that\u2019s involved in some of the decisions.\n\n___\n\nAP: You\u2019ve talked a little bit about the way that you\u2019ve brought some business skills into the office. Is there anything from your business background that just doesn\u2019t translate into the presidency, that just simply is not applicable to this job?\n\nTRUMP: Well in business, you don\u2019t necessarily need heart, whereas here, almost everything affects people. So if you\u2019re talking about health care \u2014 you have health care in business but you\u2019re trying to just negotiate a good price on health care, et cetera, et cetera. You\u2019re providing health. This is (unintelligible). Here, everything, pretty much everything you do in government, involves heart, whereas in business, most things don\u2019t involve heart.\n\nAP: What\u2019s that switch been like for you?\n\nTRUMP: In fact, in business you\u2019re actually better off without it.\n\nAP: What\u2019s making that switch been like for you?\n\nTRUMP: You have to love people. And if you love people, such a big responsibility. (unintelligible) You can take any single thing, including even taxes. I mean we\u2019re going to be doing major tax reform. Here\u2019s part of your story, it\u2019s going to be a big (unintelligible). Everybody\u2019s saying, \u201cOh, he\u2019s delaying.\u201d I\u2019m not delaying anything. I\u2019ll tell you the other thing is (unintelligible). I used to get great press. I get the worst press. I get such dishonest reporting with the media. That\u2019s another thing that really has \u2014 I\u2019ve never had anything like it before. It happened during the primaries, and I said, you know, when I won, I said, \u201cWell the one thing good is now I\u2019ll get good press.\u201d And it got worse. (unintelligible) So that was one thing that a little bit of a surprise to me. I thought the press would become better, and it actually, in my opinion, got more nasty.\n\n___\n\nAP: But in terms of tax reform, how are you going to roll that out next week?\n\nTRUMP: Well I\u2019m going to roll (out) probably on Wednesday, around Wednesday of next week, we\u2019re putting out a massive tax reform \u2014 business and for people \u2014 we want to do both. We\u2019ve been working on it (unintelligible). Secretary Mnuchin is a very talented person, very smart. Very successful (unintelligible). ... We\u2019re going to be putting that out on Wednesday or shortly thereafter. Let me leave a little room just in case (unintelligible). ... And that\u2019s a big story, because a lot of people think I\u2019m going to put it out much later.\n\nAP: Do you have any details on that in terms of rates?\n\nTRUMP: Only in terms that it will be a massive tax cut. It will be bigger, I believe, than any tax cut ever. Maybe the biggest tax cut we\u2019ve ever had. ...\n\n___\n\nAP: Obviously, that\u2019s going to come in a week where you\u2019re going to be running up against the deadline for keeping the government open. If you get a bill on your desk that does not include funding for the wall, will you sign it?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it \u2014 you\u2019ve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it\u2019s funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I\u2019ve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college \u2014 but it\u2019s a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they\u2019re 73 percent down. ... That\u2019s a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it\u2019s going lower. Now, people aren\u2019t coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through, and there isn\u2019t crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that? (Unintelligible.) Now, much of that\u2019s stopped because they can\u2019t get through.\n\nAP: It sounds like maybe you\u2019re beginning to send a message that if you do get a spending bill that doesn\u2019t have border funding in there, you would sign it.\n\nTRUMP: Well, first of all, the wall will cost much less than the numbers I\u2019m seeing. I\u2019m seeing numbers, I mean, this wall is not going to be that expensive.\n\nAP: What do you think the estimate on it would be?\n\nTRUMP: Oh I\u2019m seeing numbers \u2014 $24 billion, I think I\u2019ll do it for $10 billion or less. That\u2019s not a lot of money relative to what we\u2019re talking about. If we stop 1 percent of the drugs from coming in \u2014 and we\u2019ll stop all of it. But if we stop 1 percent of the drugs because we have the wall \u2014 they\u2019re coming around in certain areas, but if you have a wall, they can\u2019t do it because it\u2019s a real wall. That\u2019s a tremendously good investment, 1 percent. The drugs pouring through on the southern border are unbelievable. We\u2019re becoming a drug culture, there\u2019s so much. And most of it\u2019s coming from the southern border. The wall will stop the drugs.\n\nAP: But, just trying to nail you down on it one more time, will you sign a spending bill if it doesn\u2019t have \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t want to comment. I just don\u2019t know yet. I mean, I have to see what\u2019s going on. I really do. But the wall\u2019s a very important thing to \u2014 not only my base, but to the people. And even if it wasn\u2019t, I mean I\u2019ll do things that aren\u2019t necessarily popular. ... The wall is very important to stopping drugs.\n\nAP: If you don\u2019t have a funding stream, your message to your base is what?\n\nTRUMP: My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter, that wall\u2019s getting built, OK? One hundred percent. One hundred percent it\u2019s getting built. And it\u2019s also getting built for much less money \u2014 I hope you get this \u2014 than these people are estimating. The opponents are talking $25 billion for the wall. It\u2019s not going to cost anywhere near that.\n\nAP: You think $10 billion or less.\n\nTRUMP: I think $10 billion or less. And if I do a super-duper, higher, better, better security, everything else, maybe it goes a little bit more. But it\u2019s not going to be anywhere near (those) kind of numbers. And they\u2019re using those numbers; they\u2019re using the high numbers to make it sound impalatable (sic). And the fact it\u2019s going to cost much less money, just like the airplane I told you about, which I hope you can write about.\n\n___\n\n(Off-the-record discussion.)\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: They had a quote from me that NATO\u2019s obsolete. But they didn\u2019t say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn\u2019t in government. People don\u2019t go around asking about NATO if I\u2019m building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf ... asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO\u2019s obsolete \u2014 not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO \u2014 NATO is obsolete, and I said, \u201cAnd the reason it\u2019s obsolete is because of the fact they don\u2019t focus on terrorism.\u201d You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.\n\nAP: What specifically has NATO changed?\n\nTRUMP: (Cites Wall Street Journal article) ... I did an interview with Wolf Blitzer, and I said NATO was obsolete \u2014 I said two things \u2014 obsolete, and the country\u2019s aren\u2019t paying. I was right about both. I took such heat for about three days on both, because nobody ever criticized NATO. I took heat like you wouldn\u2019t believe. And then some expert on NATO said, \u201cYou know, Trump is right.\u201d But I said it was obsolete because they weren\u2019t focused on terror. ...\n\nIt\u2019s not fair that we\u2019re paying close to 4 percent and other countries that are more directly affected are paying 1 percent when they\u2019re supposed to be paying 2 percent. And I\u2019m very strong on it and I\u2019m going to be very strong on it when I go there in a month.\u201d\n\n__\n\nAP: This morning you tweeted that after the possible terrorist attack in Paris, that it will have a big effect on the upcoming French election. What did you mean by that?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think it will have a big effect on who people are going to vote for in the election.\n\nAP: Do you think it\u2019s going to help Marine Le Pen?\n\nTRUMP: I think so.\n\nAP: Do you believe that she should be the president?\n\nTRUMP: No, I have no comment on that, but I think that it\u2019ll probably help her because she is the strongest on borders and she is the strongest on what\u2019s been going on in France.\n\nAP: Do you worry at all that by saying that, that a terrorist attack would have an impact on a democratic election, that it would actually embolden terrorists to try to \u2014.\n\nTRUMP: No. Look, everybody is making predictions who is going to win. I am no different than you, you could say the same thing. ...\n\nAP: I just wonder if you are encouraging, you are the president of the United States, so to say that you worry that it encourages terrorists ...\n\nTRUMP: No, I am no different than \u2014 no, I think it discourages terrorists, I think it discourages. I think what we\u2019ve done on the border discourages it. I think that my stance on having people come in to this country that we have no idea who they are and in certain cases you will have radical Islamic terrorism. I\u2019m not going to have it in this country. I\u2019m not going to let what happened to France and other places happen here. And it\u2019s already largely, you know \u2014 we have tens \u2014 we have hundreds of thousands of people that have been allowed into our country that should not be here. They shouldn\u2019t be here. We have people allowed into our country with no documentation whatsoever. They have no documentation and they were allowed under the previous administrations, they were allowed into our country. It\u2019s a big mistake.\n\nAP: Just so that I am clear. You are not endorsing her for the office, but you are \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I am not endorsing her and I didn\u2019t mention her name.\n\nAP: Right, I just wanted to make sure I have that clear.\n\nTRUMP: I believe whoever is the toughest on radical Islamic terrorism and whoever is the toughest at the borders will do well at the election. I am not saying that person is going to win, she is not even favored to win, you know. Right now, she is in second place.\n\n___\n\nAP: I have a question on the markets, actually. One thing that I think has been different about this White House is that you do point to the markets as a sign of progress. Do you worry, though \u2014 I mean, the markets go up and down.\n\nTRUMP: You live by the sword, you die by the sword, to a certain extent. But we create a lot of jobs, 500,000 jobs as of two months ago, and plenty created since. Five hundred thousand. ... As an example, Ford, General Motors. I\u2019ve had cases where the gentleman from China, Ma, Jack Ma (chairman of Alibaba Group), he comes up, he says, \u201cOnly because of you am I making this massive investment.\u201d Intel, only because of you. ... The press never writes that.\n\n___\n\nAP: What about NAFTA? What\u2019s the plan on NAFTA?\n\nTRUMP: What would you like to know?\n\nAP: I would like to know what your plan is in terms of renegotiating.\n\nTRUMP: I am very upset with NAFTA. I think NAFTA has been a catastrophic trade deal for the United States, trading agreement for the United States. It hurts us with Canada, and it hurts us with Mexico. Most people don\u2019t even think of NAFTA in terms of Canada. You saw what happened yesterday in my statements, because if you look at the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and upstate New York, they are getting killed by NAFTA.\n\nAP: Is your plan still, though, to renegotiate the whole deal?\n\nTRUMP: I am going to either renegotiate it or I am going to terminate it.\n\nAP: Termination is still on the table.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. If they don\u2019t treat fairly, I am terminating NAFTA.\n\nAP: What\u2019s a timeline for that decision?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s a six-month termination clause, I have the right to do it, it\u2019s a six-month clause.\n\n___\n\nAP: If I could fit a couple of more topics. Jeff Sessions, your attorney general, is taking a tougher line suddenly on Julian Assange, saying that arresting him is a priority. You were supportive of what WikiLeaks was doing during the campaign with the release of the Clinton emails. Do you think that arresting Assange is a priority for the United States?\n\nTRUMP: When Wikileaks came out ... never heard of Wikileaks, never heard of it. When Wikileaks came out, all I was just saying is, \u201cWell, look at all this information here, this is pretty good stuff.\u201d You know, they tried to hack the Republican, the RNC, but we had good defenses. They didn\u2019t have defenses, which is pretty bad management. But we had good defenses, they tried to hack both of them. They weren\u2019t able to get through to Republicans. No, I found it very interesting when I read this stuff and I said, \u201cWow.\u201d It was just a figure of speech. I said, \u201cWell, look at this. It\u2019s good reading.\u201d\n\nAP: But that didn\u2019t mean that you supported what Assange is doing?\n\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t support or unsupport. It was just information. They shouldn\u2019t have allowed it to get out. If they had the proper defensive devices on their internet, you know, equipment, they wouldn\u2019t even allow the FBI. How about this \u2014 they get hacked, and the FBI goes to see them, and they won\u2019t let the FBI see their server. But do you understand, nobody ever writes it. Why wouldn\u2019t (former Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John) Podesta and Hillary Clinton allow the FBI to see the server? They brought in another company that I hear is Ukrainian-based.\n\nAP: CrowdStrike?\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s what I heard. I heard it\u2019s owned by a very rich Ukrainian, that\u2019s what I heard. But they brought in another company to investigate the server. Why didn\u2019t they allow the FBI in to investigate the server? I mean, there is so many things that nobody writes about. It\u2019s incredible.\n\nAP: Can I just ask you, though \u2014 do you believe it is a priority for the United States, or it should be a priority, to arrest Julian Assange?\n\nTRUMP: I am not involved in that decision, but if Jeff Sessions wants to do it, it\u2019s OK with me. I didn\u2019t know about that decision, but if they want to do it, it\u2019s OK with me.\n\n___\n\nAP: On Iran, which is another thing you talked a lot on the campaign \u2014\n\nTRUMP: And the other thing that we should go after is the leakers. ...\n\nAP: On Iran, you also talked about it quite a bit on the campaign trail. And you said in the press conference yesterday that you think that Iran is violating the spirit of the agreement. When you say that, do you mean in terms of the actual nuclear accord, or do you mean what they are doing in the region?\n\nTRUMP: In terms of what they are doing all over the Middle East and beyond.\n\nAP: So you believe that they are complying with the agreement?\n\nTRUMP: No, I don\u2019t say that. I say that I believe they have broken the spirit of the agreement. There is a spirit to agreements, and they have broken it.\n\nAP: In terms of what they are doing elsewhere in the Middle East?\n\nTRUMP: In terms of what they are doing of all over.\n\nAP: When you talk to European leaders, when you talk to Merkel, for example, or Teresa May, what do they say about the nuclear deal? Do they want you to stay in that deal?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t talk to them about it.\n\nAP: You don\u2019t talk to them about the Iran deal?\n\nTRUMP: I mention it, but it\u2019s very personal when I talk to them, you know, it\u2019s confidential. No, they have their own opinions. I don\u2019t say that they are different than my opinions, but I\u2019d rather have you ask them that question.\n\nAP: At this point, do you believe that you will stay in the nuclear deal?\n\nTRUMP: It\u2019s possible that we won\u2019t.\n\n___\n\nAP: Dreamers, you\u2019ve talked about them, you\u2019ve talked about heart earlier. This is one area where you have talked \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No, we aren\u2019t looking to do anything right now. Look, the dreamers ... this is an interesting case, they left and they came back and he\u2019s got some problems, it\u2019s a little different than the dreamer case, right? But we are putting MS-13 in jail and getting them the hell out of our country. They\u2019ve taken over towns and cities and we are being really brutal with MS-13, and that\u2019s what we should be. They are a bad group, and somebody said they are as bad as al-Qaida, which is a hell of a reference. So we are moving criminals out of our country and we are getting them out in record numbers and those are the people we are after. We are not after the dreamers, we are after the criminals.\n\nAP: And that\u2019s going to be the policy of your administration to allow the dreamers to stay?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. Yes. That\u2019s our policy. I am not saying ... long-term, we are going to have to fix the problem, the whole immigration problem. But I will tell you: Right now we have a great gentleman, one of my real stars is Gen. (John) Kelly, now (Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly. We are down 73 percent at the border, we are cleaning out cities and towns of hard-line criminals, some of the worst people on earth, people that rape and kill women, people that are killing people just for the sake of having fun. They are being thrown in jails and they are being ... all over the country and nobody\u2019s ever done it like us, so we are being unbelievably thorough with that. We are out in Long Island cleaning out the MS-13 scum, they are all scum, that\u2019s probably the worst gang anywhere on Earth. ...\n\nAP: A lot of the dreamers have been hoping to hear something from you. I don\u2019t want to give them the wrong message with this.\n\nTRUMP: Here is what they can hear: The dreamers should rest easy. OK? I\u2019ll give you that. The dreamers should rest easy. ...\n\n___\n\n(An aide talks about the president\u2019s address to Congress.)\n\nTRUMP: A lot of the people have said that, some people said it was the single best speech ever made in that chamber.\n\nAP: You seem like you enjoyed it.\n\nTRUMP: I did. I did. I believed in it and I enjoyed it. It was a great feeling to introduce the wife of a great young soldier who died getting us very valuable information. Have you seen the tremendous success? ... That\u2019s another thing that nobody talks about. Have you seen the tremendous success we\u2019ve had in the Middle East with the ISIS (an abbreviation for the Islamic State group)? When (current Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al) Abadi left from Iraq, he said Trump has more success in eight weeks than Obama had in eight years. ... We have had tremendous success, but we don\u2019t talk about it. We don\u2019t talk about it.\n\nAP: Do you mean you don\u2019t talk about it personally because you don\u2019t want to talk about it?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t talk about it. No. And the generals don\u2019t talk about it.\n\n___\n\nAP: You had put a request into the Pentagon to put forward an ISIS plan within 30 days. I know they have sent that over. Have you accepted a plan? Are you moving forward on a strategy?\n\nTRUMP: We have a very strong plan, but we cannot talk about it, Julie.\n\nAP: So you have decided on a plan?\n\nTRUMP: Remember how many times have you been to the speech where I talked about Mosul.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP. Right. Mosul. Four months we are going in, three months. We are still fighting Mosul. You know why? Because they were prepared. If we would have gone in and just done it, it would have been over three months ago.\n\nAP: Can you say generally what the strategy is? Should people \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Generally is we have got to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. And other terrorist organizations.\n\nAP: Should Americans who are serving in the military expect that you are going to increase troop numbers in the Middle East to fight ISIS?\n\nTRUMP: No, not much.\n\nAP: In terms of the strategy, though, that you have accepted, it sounds like, from the generals \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Well, they\u2019ve also accepted my strategy.\n\nAP: Does that involve more troops on the ground, it sounds like?\n\nTRUMP: Not many.\n\nAP: So a small increase?\n\nTRUMP: It could be an increase, then an increase. But not many more. I want to do the job, but not many more. ... This is an important story. I\u2019ve done a lot. I\u2019ve done more than any other president in the first 100 days and I think the first 100 days is an artificial barrier. And I\u2019m scheduled ... the foundations have been set to do some great things. With foreign countries. Look at, look at President Xi. I mean ...\n\nAP: What do you think it was about your chemistry?\n\nTRUMP: We had good chemistry. Now I don\u2019t know that I think that\u2019s going to produce results but you\u2019ve got a good chance.\n\nAP: Uh-huh.\n\nTRUMP: Look, he turned down many coal ships. These massive coal ships are coming where they get a lot of their income. They\u2019re coming into China and they\u2019re being turned away. That\u2019s never happened before. The fuel, the oil, so many different things. You saw the editorial they had in their paper saying they cannot be allowed to have nuclear, you know, et cetera. People have said they\u2019ve never seen this ever before in China. We have the same relationship with others. There\u2019s a great foundation that\u2019s built. Great foundation. And I think it\u2019s going to produce tremendous results for our country.\n\n___\n\nAP: One more 100 days question.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s fine.\n\nAP: ... is do you think you have the right team in place for your next 100 days?\n\nTRUMP: Yes. I think my team has been, well, I have different teams. I think my military team has been treated with great respect. As they should be. I think my other team hasn\u2019t been treated with the respect that they should get. We have some very talented people, and very diverse people.\n\nAP: Do you mean your White House team when you say that?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, my White House team. I think Reince (Priebus) has been doing an excellent job. I think that, you know, this is a very tough environment not caused necessarily by me. Although the election has, you know, look, the Democrats had a tremendous opportunity because the electoral college, as I said, is so skewed to them. You start off by losing in New York and California, no matter who it is. If, if Abe Lincoln came back to life, he would lose New York and he would lose California. It\u2019s just the registration, there\u2019s nothing you can do. So you\u2019re losing the two biggest states, that\u2019s where you start. OK. The Electoral College is so skewed in favor of a Democrat that it\u2019s very, very hard. Look at Obama\u2019s number in the Electoral College. His numbers on the win were ... but the Electoral College numbers were massive. You lose New York, you lose Illinois. Illinois is impossible to win. And you look at, so now you lose New York, Illinois, no matter what you do, and California. Right. And you say, man. Now you have to win Florida, you have to win Ohio, you have to win North Carolina. You have to win all these states, and then I won Wisconsin and Michigan and all of these other places, but you remember there was no way to, there was no way to 270.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: So she had this massive advantage, she spent hundreds of millions of dollars more money than I spent. Hundreds of millions ... Yeah. Or more, actually because we were $375 she was at $2.2 billion. But whatever. She spent massive amounts of money more and she lost. Solidly lost, because you know it wasn\u2019t 270, it was 306. So there\u2019s anger. But there was massive anger before I got there, so it\u2019s not easy for a White House staff to realize that you are going into a situation where you are going to be at no, where are going to get no votes. I mean, here\u2019s a judge who is No. 1 at Columbia, No. 1 at Harvard and an Oxford scholar. And he got three votes.\n\nAP: Three Democratic votes, but yeah.\n\nTRUMP: Three Democratic votes. OK. He\u2019s an Oxford scholar at the highest level. The No. 1, you know, one of the great academics, one of the great writers. No bad decisions with all ... nothing. He\u2019s like a ...\n\nAP: Do you think that you can break through that? I mean this \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Yeah, I do.\n\nAP: Is one of the biggest challenges for a president.\n\nTRUMP: I think (I) can to an extent. But there\u2019s a, there\u2019s a basic hard-line core that you can\u2019t break though, OK, that you can\u2019t break through. There\u2019s a hard-line group you can\u2019t break through, you can\u2019t. It\u2019s sad. You can\u2019t. Look, I met with Congressman Cummings and I really liked him, a lot. Elijah Cummings (of Maryland). I really liked him a lot. And during the conversation because we have a very strong mutual feeling on drug prices. He came to see me, at my invitation, because I saw him talking about, he came to see me about drug prices because drug prices are ridiculous. And I am going to get them way, way, way down and he liked that. He said you will be the greatest president. He said you will be, in front of five, six people, he said you will be the greatest president in the history of this country.\n\nAP: He disputed that slightly.\n\nTRUMP: That\u2019s what he said. I mean, what can I tell you?\n\nAP: Yeah.\n\nTRUMP: There\u2019s six people sitting here. What did he, what, what do you mean by slightly?\n\nAP: He said, he said that he felt like you could be a great president if and then \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Well he said, you\u2019ll be the greatest president in the history of, but you know what, I\u2019ll take that also, but that you could be. But he said, will be the greatest president but I would also accept the other. In other words, if you do your job, but I accept that. Then I watched him interviewed and it was like he never even was here. It\u2019s incredible. I watched him interviewed a week later and it\u2019s like he was never in my office. And you can even say that.\n\n___\n\nAP: And that\u2019s one of the difficulties I think presidents have had is that you can have these personal relationships with people from the other party, but then it\u2019s hard to actually change how people vote or change how people \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No I have, it\u2019s interesting, I have, seem to get very high ratings. I definitely. You know Chris Wallace had 9.2 million people, it\u2019s the highest in the history of the show. I have all the ratings for all those morning shows. When I go, they go double, triple. Chris Wallace, look back during the Army-Navy football game, I did his show that morning.\n\nAP: I remember, right.\n\nTRUMP: It had 9.2 million people. It\u2019s the highest they\u2019ve ever had. On any, on air, (CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host John) Dickerson had 5.2 million people. It\u2019s the highest for \u201cFace the Nation\u201d or as I call it, \u201cDeface the Nation.\u201d It\u2019s the highest for \u201cDeface the Nation\u201d since the World Trade Center. Since the World Trade Center came down. It\u2019s a tremendous advantage.\n\nI have learned one thing, because I get treated very unfairly, that\u2019s what I call it, the fake media. And the fake media is not all of the media. You know they tried to say that the fake media was all the, no. The fake media is some of you. I could tell you who it is, 100 percent. Sometimes you\u2019re fake, but \u2014 but the fake media is some of the media. It bears no relationship to the truth. It\u2019s not that Fox treats me well, it\u2019s that Fox is the most accurate.\n\nAP: Do you believe that? That Fox \u2014\n\nTRUMP: I do. I get treated so badly. Yesterday, about the thing, you know when I said it\u2019s a terrorism ... it may be. I said it may be a terrorist attack and MSNBC, I heard, went crazy, \u201cHe called it a terrorist attack.\u201d They thought it was a bank robbery. By the way, I\u2019m 10-0 for that. I\u2019ve called every one of them. Every time they said I called it way too early and then it turns out I\u2019m ... Whatever. Whatever. In the meantime, I\u2019m here and they\u2019re not.\n\n___\n\nAP: Do you feel that one of the things with cable is there\u2019s such real-time reaction with everything you say?\n\nTRUMP: Yeah.\n\nAP: Can you separate that sometimes from that actual decision?\n\nTRUMP: The one thing \u2014\n\nAP: That you have to do \u2014\n\nTRUMP: OK. The one thing I\u2019ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don\u2019t watch CNN anymore.\n\nAP: You just said you did.\n\nTRUMP: No. No, I, if I\u2019m passing it, what did I just say (inaudible)?\n\nAP: You just said \u2014\n\nTRUMP: Where? Where?\n\nAP: Two minutes ago.\n\nTRUMP: No, they treat me so badly. No, I just said that. No, I, what\u2019d I say, I stopped watching them. But I don\u2019t watch CNN anymore. I don\u2019t watch MSNBC. I don\u2019t watch it. Now I heard yesterday that MSNBC, you know, they tell me what\u2019s going on.\n\nAP: Right.\n\nTRUMP: In fact, they also did. I never thought I had the ability to not watch. Like, people think I watch (MSNBC\u2019s) \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d I don\u2019t watch \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d I never thought I had the ability to, and who used to treat me great by the way, when I played the game. I never thought I had the ability to not watch what is unpleasant, if it\u2019s about me. Or pleasant. But when I see it\u2019s such false reporting and such bad reporting and false reporting that I\u2019ve developed an ability that I never thought I had. I don\u2019t watch things that are unpleasant. I just don\u2019t watch them.\n\nAP: And do you feel like that\u2019s, that\u2019s because of the office that you now occupy \u2014\n\nTRUMP: No.\n\nAP: That you\u2019ve made that change?\n\nTRUMP: I don\u2019t know why it is, but I\u2019ve developed that ability, and it\u2019s happened over the last, over the last year.\n\nAP: That\u2019s interesting.\n\nTRUMP: And I don\u2019t watch things that I know are going to be unpleasant. CNN has covered me unfairly and incorrectly and I don\u2019t watch them anymore. A lot of people don\u2019t watch them anymore, they\u2019re now in third place. But I\u2019ve created something where people are watching ... but I don\u2019t watch CNN anymore. I don\u2019t watch MSNBC anymore. I don\u2019t watch things, and I never thought I had that ability. I always thought I\u2019d watch.\n\nAP: Sure.\n\nTRUMP: I just don\u2019t. And that\u2019s taken place over the last year. And you know what that is, that\u2019s a great, it\u2019s a great thing because you leave, you leave for work in the morning you know, you\u2019re, you don\u2019t watch this total negativity. I never thought I\u2019d be able to do that and for me, it\u2019s so easy to do now. Just don\u2019t watch.\n\nAP: That\u2019s interesting.\n\nTRUMP: Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m here. I don\u2019t know.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005041&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://apnews.com/en_badge_web_generic.png", "https://apnews.com/images/ShareLogo2.png"], "top_img": "https://apnews.com/images/ShareLogo2.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://apnews.com/c810d7de280a47e88848b0ac74690c83", "title": "Transcript of AP interview with Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "theme-color": "#dedede", "msapplication-config": "browserconfig.xml", "description": "A transcript of an Oval Office interview Friday with President Donald Trump by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace.
