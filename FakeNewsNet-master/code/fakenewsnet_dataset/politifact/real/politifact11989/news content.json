Trump also dismissed outrage at his purported mocking of a disabled New York Times reporter, saying he simply does not remember meeting the scribe.\n\nAway from the spotlight, Donald Trump has also been seeking to minimize his past business ties with Sater, the Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 who appeared in photos with Trump, and carried a Trump Organization business card with the title \u201cSenior Advisor to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAsked last week about Sater by The Associated Press, Trump again seemed unable to retrieve a solid memory of the man. \"Felix Sater, boy, I have to even think about it,\" he told the reporter. \"I'm not that familiar with him.\"\n\nTrump and Sater can be seen together in photographs attending a Denver business conference in 2005, and the two men posed on stage together at the 2007 launch party for the Trump SoHo Hotel and Condominium project. And in 2010, according to Trump\u2019s lawyer, Sater was provided business cards by the Trump Organization identifying him as a \u201csenior advisor\" to Trump.\n\nSater has declined repeated requests for an interview, citing the advice of his attorney. But he has not been shy about posting items online touting his ties to Trump. On his website, he called the Trump SoHo his \u201cmost prized project.\u201d For years he identified himself on his online resume at the LinkedIn website as having been a \"senior advisor\" to Trump in 2010-2011. Last month, after ABC News asked Trump\u2019s attorney about it, that portion of Sater\u2019s online resume was deleted.\n\nThe \u201csenior advisor\u201d title stands in sharp contrast to how Trump and his aides have repeatedly described the nature of their connection with Sater, including in response to questions from ABC News.\n\nAlan Garten, Trump\u2019s General Counsel, initially told ABC News that Trump \u201chad no real direct relationship with Felix Sater\u201d and that Sater was not an advisor to Donald Trump \u201cin my mind, and not in anyone at the Trump Organization's mind.\u201d\n\nA few days later, Garten confirmed the authenticity of Sater\u2019s Trump business card with the \u201csenior advisor\u201d title which included a Trump Organization email address and phone number. But the lawyer said the title was not reflective of Sater\u2019s actual role. It was common practice in the real estate industry, he said, to provide business cards and bestow titles \u201cin order for brokers to be able to make initial introductions.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump exits the Budweiser Events Center after talking at the Bixpo 2005 convention in Loveland, Colo., Sept. 14, 2005.

Cyrus McCrimmon/Denver Post/Getty Images\n\nGarten said Sater was \u201cnever employed by or on the payroll of the Trump organization\u201d and that \u201cno deals ever came from those activities\u201d in 2010. But Garten declined to respond to emails and phone messages with further questions, including whether Sater was provided office space or compensated by the Trump organization in any other way. Images of Sater\u2019s business card were wiped from the internet shortly after ABC News asked Garten about it.\n\nTrump\u2019s extensive business relationships are garnering fresh attention as the public is becoming better acquainted with the real estate mogul-turned-politician who has catapulted into front-runner territory in the race for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nThe cast of characters who participated in Trump\u2019s many development deals touch on a topic the candidate regularly cites on the campaign trail -- his judgment at the helm of his real estate empire. Trump says his \u201ctremendous\u201d record of success is one of his most important qualifications to become President of the United States.\n\nThe connection to Felix Sater dates to the early 2000's when the Trump Organization worked on several occasions with a small development firm based in Trump Tower called the Bayrock Group, where Sater was an executive until 2007.\n\nAs Trump explained it during a 2013 deposition, the relationship began when Bayrock was a tenant in his Trump Tower office building, when \u201csomebody from Bayrock, I'm not exactly sure, came to see -- either myself or one of my children\u201d with a proposal for a development deal. \u201cIt could have been Felix Sater, it could have been -- I really don't know who it might have been,\u201d Trump said, \u201cbut somebody from Bayrock.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump is deposed under oath during a civil lawsuit in November 2013. Obtained by ABC News\n\nSater had already served prison time for a grisly 1991 assault at the El Rio Grande restaurant and bar in New York. According to court documents, Sater allegedly told a man at the bar, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you. I\u2019ll rip your f****** head off and stick it down your throat.\u201d Sater then allegedly grabbed a frozen margarita from the bar, flung the contents in the air, smashed the glass on the bar, and stabbed the man in the cheek and neck, breaking his cheek and jaw, lacerating face and neck and severing nerves. He was convicted of first degree assault.\n\nAs he began his work with Bayrock, Sater was also awaiting sentencing for his role in what authorities called a $40 million \u201cpump and dump\u201d stock scam. Federal prosecutors announced in a March 2, 2000 press release that Sater had pleaded guilty in the federal racketeering case, and was found to have been collaborating with members of four New York mob families. Sater and others had \u201cplanned and carried out a series of fraudulent securities schemes and then laundered tens of millions of dollars in illicit profits,\u201d the release said.\n\nProsecutors said Sater and others had \u201cenlisted the help of individuals affiliated with organized crimes families of La Cosa Nostra to protect and promote their criminal activities.\u201d\n\nSater avoided prison after FBI agents testified at his sentencing hearing that he had become an important government witness on both mob-related and national security matters, heralded by federal agents for his cooperation. His lawyer, Robert Wolf, told the Associated Press that some of the information about Sater in public records and lawsuits is defamatory. Wolf told the AP that credits Sater's stint as a government cooperator with potentially saving American military lives, although he did not provide details. Wolf told the AP to write about Sater's past \"at your own risk\" but did not cite specific concerns.\n\nDuring this period, Sater\u2019s role at Bayrock was not clearly defined. He at various times appeared in company emails and other records as the \u201cchief operating officer\u201d or \u201cmanaging director.\u201d In a 2010 deposition Sater said titles at the firm varied. \u201cI was probably number two man in the company,\u201d he said. \u201cThe actual position, I don't remember what it was.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trump SoHo project was considered a success, four other Bayrock projects were either never built or were finished by others. Some of them resulted in lawsuits from unhappy investors. In each case, Trump was not the actual developer of the project and was, instead, paid a fee to license the use of his name and potentially operate the hotel projects.\n\nDuring this period, Trump and Bayrock also collaborated on a proposal for the 600,000-square-foot Trump International Hotel and Residences, Phoenix, that was to include a spa, swimming pools, \u201cexquisite gardens,\u201d and \u201ca world-class celebrity chef restaurant.\u201d\n\nThe project never got off the ground, however, and in a 2007 lawsuit filed in state court against \u201cthe Trump/Bayrock Organization,\u201d the plaintiff alleged that Sater threatened one of the Arizona partners in the deal, a man named Earnest Mennes. Sater was alleged to have told Mennes he would call in a relative to \u201celectrically shock Mr. Mennes' testicles, cut off Mr. Mennes' legs, and leave Mr. Mennes dead in the trunk of his car.\u201d\n\nSater\u2019s lawyer calls the allegation \u201can outright fabrication\u201d made as part of a lawsuit demanding a financial settlement.\n\nReached in Arizona, Mennes said the matter had been settled out of court and he could not discuss it. Mennes said he reflects proudly on the time he worked on the Trump project, and considers Trump a masterful businessman. Trump\u2019s lawyer said he was unaware of the allegations in the Arizona lawsuit.\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney says the real estate mogul had minimal interaction with Sater on the various joint ventures with Bayrock, and so had no reason to probe deeply into his background.\n\n\u201cTo be clear,\u201d Garten told ABC News, \u201cMr. Sater's involvement in the projects, the projects that went forward, SoHo and Fort Lauderdale, may have existed in the beginning, but long term there was very little involvement.\u201d\n\nSater's alleged ties to organized crime were more widely publicized in December 2007 when The New York Times published an article featuring Sater\u2019s ties to Trump and describing his \u201ctangled past.\u201d The article reported that Sater \u201chad been an \u2018unindicted co-conspirator\u2019 and a key figure in a $40 million scheme involving 19 stockbrokers and organized crime figures from four Mafia families.\u201d\n\nSater told the Times that activity was in the past. \u201cI\u2019m trying to lead an exemplary existence,\u201d he said then. \u201cOld, bad luggage is not something anyone wants to remember.\u201d\n\nWhile Sater\u2019s criminal conviction had been publicized, much of his role in the racketeering case had until that point been kept secret -- sealed by the government because Sater had become a \u201ccooperator\u201d on a range of matters.\n\nSater\u2019s attorney provided ABC News with a copy of a public statement from Attorney General Loretta Lynch, whose New York office had enlisted cooperation from Sater when she was serving as a U.S. Attorney.\n\n\u201cThe defendant in question, Felix Sater, provided valuable and sensitive information to the government during the course of his cooperation,\u201d her statement said. He provided information \u201ccrucial to national security and the conviction of over 20 individuals, including those responsible for committing massive financial fraud and members of La Cosa Nostra.\u201d\n\nGarten said Trump read the 2007 Times report and was \u201csurprised.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had no idea,\u201d Garten said. It \u201cwas the first time that both the Trump organization and Bayrock learned of Mr. Sater's background.\u201d\n\nGarten added, \u201cWhen you go into business with another company, you're going to vet that company certainly, but you're not going to vet every employee, it\u2019s just not appropriate.\"\n\nOnce that information became publicly known, Garten initially told ABC News, Trump \u201ccut all ties\u201d with Sater. But, Garten then acknowledged, the Trump organization continued to listen to deals pitched by Sater well after that.\n\nAsked why Trump would listen to a deal brought by a twice-convicted felon with alleged mafia ties, Garten told ABC News, \u201cYou\u2019re going to look at the deal, you\u2019re not going to look at the broker.\u201d\n\nDuring his 2013 deposition, when asked about how much he knew about Sater\u2019s past, Trump said he knew Sater had \u201cgot into trouble because he got into a barroom fight which a lot of people do.\u201d And, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know him very well, but I don\u2019t think he was connected to the mafia.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, the BBC pressed Trump asking why he didn\u2019t say \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d to Sater after reports surfaced alleging Sater had ties to organized crime, Trump ultimately rose from his chair mid-interview.\n\n\u201cI hate to do this, but I do have that big group of people waiting so I have to leave,\u201d he said, walking out of the room.\n\nTrump said during the deposition four months later he could not recall doing the BBC interview.\n\nIn August, the Washington Examiner asked Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, about the mogul\u2019s past dealings with Sater. \"I have no idea who Felix Sater is, he has nothing to do with the Donald J. Trump for President presidential campaign,\" Lewandowski replied. \"I've never heard of the guy.\u201d\n\nFor investors who put money into those Trump-branded projects based on the reputation of the man behind the name brand, news that one of the people involved, Sater, had such a checkered criminal history was distressing.\n\nCathy Cather, a Fort Lauderdale healthcare consultant, invested and lost money in the Trump condominium hotel project in her hometown \u2013 which failed in part because of the economic collapse. She told ABC News she made her decision in part based on glossy brochures emblazoned with Trump\u2019s photos and such slogans as \"There is luxury... And then there is THE TRUMP EXPERIENCE.\"\n\n\u201cI invested because it was Trump,\u201d Cather told ABC News.\n\nABC News' Randy Kreider and Alex Hosenball contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/GTY_trump_sater_lf_151020_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/abc_sater_card_lf_151130.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/GTY_trump_sater_lf_151020_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "Matthew Mosk", "Brian Ross", "December", "Min Read"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/memory-lapse-trump-seeks-distance-advisor-past-ties/story?id=34600826", "title": "Memory Lapse?
