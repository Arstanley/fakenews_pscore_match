Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nPeter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and Russia\u2019s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he\u2019s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump\u2019s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nReports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI\u2019s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok\u2019s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok \u201cintends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.\u201d\n\nThe letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, \u201cNo. No he won\u2019t. We\u2019ll stop it.\u201d The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with \u201cspecific investigative decisions,\u201d but said that comment and others \u201cimplies a willingness to take official action.\u201d\n\nStrzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn\u2019t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump\u2019s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there\u2019s \u201cno question\u201d that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that \u201cI think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.\u201d\n\nMueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.\n\nGoelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent \u201cintends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that\u2019s a topic, and his own integrity.\u201d\n\nTrump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general\u2019s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump\u2019s allies from calling for Mueller\u2019s immediate suspension.\n\nWhy was the FBI\u2019s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that \u201cwe\u2019ll stop\u201d Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\n\u201cThe highest level of bias I\u2019ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.\u201d Trey Gowdy on the FBI\u2019s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn\u2019t it? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018\n\nStrzok still works for the FBI, but it\u2019s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.", "images": ["https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/18/18-goodlatte.w700.h700.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/nymag-covers/2019/2019-12-18.w90.h120.2x.jpg", "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/18/18-goodlatte.w1200.h630.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/18/18-goodlatte.w1200.h630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Margaret Hartmann"], "canonical_link": "http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/fbi-agent-peter-strzok-will-testify-before-congress.html", "title": "Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Peter Strzok, FBI Agent in Texting Scandal, Will Testify Before Congress", "url": "http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/06/fbi-agent-peter-strzok-will-testify-before-congress.html", "description": "His attorney said he\u2019s willing to testify without immunity, and \u201cintends to answer any question put to him.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/18/18-goodlatte.w1200.h630.jpg", "site_name": "Intelligencer", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "FBI Agent Peter Strzok Will Testify Before Congress", "description": "His attorney said he\u2019s willing to testify without immunity, and \u201cintends to answer any question put to him.\u201d", "image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2018/06/18/18-goodlatte.w600.h315.2x.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@MargHartmann", "site": "@intelligencer"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-18T05:04:37.365-04:00", "tag": "peter strzok, congress, robert mueller, russia probe, mueller probe, politics", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "opinion": "true"}, "description": "Peter Strzok\u2019s attorney said he\u2019s willing to testify before Congress without immunity, and \u201cintends to answer any question put to him.\u201d", "sailthru.tags": "peter strzok, congress, robert mueller, russia probe, mueller probe, politics", "author": "Margaret Hartmann", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Intelligencer", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Intelligencer", "application-name": "Intelligencer", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/intelligencer/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529312677.365, "source": "http://nymag.com", "summary": ""}
