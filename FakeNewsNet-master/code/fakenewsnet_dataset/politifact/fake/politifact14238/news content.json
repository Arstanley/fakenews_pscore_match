Upon clearing the first-floor of the home, the responding officers realized that the blaring music was coming from the home\u2019s basement.\n\nAccording to the officers, a bizarre crime scene was quickly uncovered upon entering the basement. Three men, which have since been identified as 62-year-old William Provost, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore were sitting in a circle on the basement\u2019s concrete floor and ritualistically chanting while eating what police initially believed was an animal carcass, but was later identified as human remains.\n\nWilliam Provost, who police believe to be the group\u2019s ringleader, admitted to practicing cannibalism and told arresting officers:\n\n\u201cI find human flesh to be the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression. If expensive pharmaceutical drugs helped, I would figure out a way to obtain them, but they don\u2019t, so I stick to what works for me\u201d.\n\nUpon searching the home\u2019s basement, police made several startling discoveries including a large room that appears to contain nothing more than decades worth of clutter, but upon further inspection, police discovered human remains hidden throughout the old wooden furniture and broken appliances.\n\nPolice also discovered a kitchen style refrigerator located in a small room in the corner of the basement that contained the limbs, organs, and miscellaneous remains of what police believe to be upwards of 7-8 different individuals.\n\nIn addition to the refrigerator, the small room in the basement also housed a make-shift \u2018tool wall\u2019 that contained a myriad of tools that police believe were used to dismember several victims.\n\nUpon their initial investigation, police believe the 3-men have been practicing cannibalism for the past 3-4 years and largely remained under the radar due to their practice of targeting and befriending homeless drifters they met at small dive-bars located upwards of 100-miles from their Vernal Heights residence.\n\nVernal Heights Chief of Police, Gregory Moore, spoke to reporters during a brief press-conference this morning.\n\n\u201cThough modern-day cannibalism is extremely rare, it does unfortunately exist. That said -treating diabetes and or depression has to be the most bizarre reason for practicing cannibalism that I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\nProvost\u2019s accomplices, 51-year-old Dennis Ratcliff, and 36-year-old Michael Dore, also admitted to cannibalizing human flesh because they believed it would cure depression and told arresting officer\u2019s that Provost took them under his wing in late-2012.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, police and detectives are still conducting a search at the residence located at 3845 Toolson Lane.\n\nAll three men are currently being held without bail at the Vernal Heights Municipal Jail.", "images": ["http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-recent-posts-widget/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-01-05-at-10.50.34-AM.png&h=75&w=75&z=0", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Tools.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/default/32/twitter.png", "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53bdb25ab304f0f972e13559df508f67?s=75&d=identicon&r=pg", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/default/32/youtube.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Home.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-recent-posts-widget/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/497848_02_military_gear_and_clothing_640.jpg&h=75&w=75&z=0", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/default/32/stumble.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-recent-posts-widget/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/camden4j.jpg&h=75&w=75&z=0", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Basement-Fridge.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/default/32/tumblr.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/default/32/pinterest.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibal-Basement.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibals.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/SPLAT-LOLO1.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-widget/images/default/32/facebook.png", "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/plugins/advanced-recent-posts-widget/timthumb/thumb.php?src=http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2014-12-29-at-7.58.48-PM.png&h=75&w=75&z=0"], "top_img": "http://dailybuzzlive.com/wp-content/uploads/Cannibals.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daily Buzz Live"], "canonical_link": "http://dailybuzzlive.com/cannibals-arrested-florida/", "title": "Cannibals Arrested in Florida Claim Eating Human Flesh Cures Diabetes and Depression", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\u201cHuman flesh is the only thing that cures my type-2 diabetes and chronic depression.
