We\u2019re going to bring it back and were going to make America as strong as we were in the Sixties,\u201d Trump declared while addressing supporters at the Pacific Amphitheater in Costa Mesa.\n\n\u201cI love the Sixties,\u201d said Trump, continuing, \u201cI was a very big supporter of the Vietnam war and, of course, the troops. No one supports the troops more than I do.\u201d In addition to bringing back military conscription, Mr. Trump said that if elected, he will enact legislation that will guarantee citizenship to anyone who serves in the armed forces for a minimum of four years. \u201cYou have people coming into this country, coming over our borders, expecting a free ride. We\u2019re not going to give it to them, folks. They\u2019re going to have to earn their citizenship.\u201d\n\nTrump has repeatedly stated that he won\u2019t rule out using nuclear weapons against the Islamic State. On Thursday he expanded on his claims, saying he would instruct the Pentagon to begin testing \u201cman-portable\u201d tactical nuclear weapons to be used by American soldiers on the battlefield. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have unquestionable military dominance if we\u2019re seen as too weak to use these weapons against our enemies.\u201d\n\nRather than use conventional means such as drone strikes or economic sanctions to respond to acts of terrorism or other forms of aggression against the United States, Trump vowed to exercise the nuclear option \u201cextremely\u201d liberally. \u201cMy feeling is we have these weapons and we\u2019ve spent a great deal of money developing and improving them over the years; there\u2019s absolutely no reason why we shouldn\u2019t be using them.\u201d\n\nThe former reality TV star accused President Obama of making the country less safe by employing tact and diplomacy when dealing with foreign leaders. \u201cThis guy\u2019s the president of the United States and he\u2019s bowing to the Chinese. They\u2019re laughing in our faces, okay? They\u2019re laughing in our faces and if we don\u2019t do something about it, they\u2019re going to surpass us militarily and economically and then we\u2019re going to have a huge problem on our hands.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump kicked off the start of his California campaign on Thursday where he made a stop in Costa Mesa, a semi-rural farming community located in Orange County. The GOP presidential hopeful is scheduled to address California\u2019s Republican convention on Friday.", "images": ["http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/2c27eb54aa7805a1b6cecd9e9b70d0e0?s=56&d=mm&r=g",
