Now, though, the 41-year-old actor says he\u2019s going to travel to Mars \u2014 but for real.\n\nWell, at least that\u2019s what he told President Barack Obama.\n\nDiCaprio was at the White House on Monday night as part of the South by South Lawn event. The actor, the president, and climate scientist Dr. Katharine Hayhoe took the stage towards the end of the evening for a conversation on climate change before the U.S. premiere of DiCaprio\u2019s new documentary on the subject, Before the Flood.\n\nThe subject of Mars and SpaceX came up while Hayhoe was talking about the need to make people connect with the reality of climate change on a universal, human level. \u201cThe most important thing to do is not to pile up scientific reports until they reach a tottering pile of about 8 feet where they tip over and crush somebody,\u201d Hayhoe said, explaining that what really matters when trying to motivate people to combat climate change thing is to connect its real meaning and impact to \u201cwhat\u2019s in our hearts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe reality of it is, if you\u2019re a human living on this planet \u2014 which most of us are, yeah?\u201d she joked. \u201cAs long as we haven\u2019t signed up for the trip to Mars. I don\u2019t want to know if anyone has, I think you\u2019re crazy.\u201d\n\nAs Hayhoe expressed her belief that anyone who was on board with Elon Musk\u2019s recently detailed plans for a possibly deadly trip to Mars was nuts, DiCaprio chimed in to say, \u201cI did.\u201d\n\nHayhoe attempted to assure the famous actor that she didn\u2019t actually think he was nuts, but Obama jumped in.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019ll acknowledge he\u2019s crazy,\u201d the president said with a smile.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the millionaire actor really plans on traveling to Mars and quite possibly dying in the process. Remember, though, Leo finally won an Oscar for his role in The Revenant, in part due to the brutal conditions he endured while filming it. Maybe, just maybe, he figured the only place tougher than frozen uncharted western territories is the Martian surface. The Academy would love it.\n\nIt\u2019s probably method acting, is what we\u2019re saying.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, and Leonardo DiCaprio talk climate change.\n\nEarlier in the night, Obama made a Star Trek reference while talking about the importance of flawed but useful energy sources like fracking and nuclear power. \u201cUntil we invent the perfect energy source \u2014 Lithium crystals or whatever, Scotty\u2019s there beaming us up \u2014 but until then we need to live in the real world,\u201d Obama said.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1455869871397255&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=19987187&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=275370&fmt=gif", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?rect=0%2C509%2C2048%2C1026&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1200", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?rect=0%2C509%2C2048%2C1026&auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=650", "https://alb.reddit.com/snoo.gif?q=CAAHAAABAAoACQAAAAACWQ1QAA==&s=XEpByt_R434fqqGl0DfctKqGILDzrA7eDqfNEeDOv7E=", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/assets/placeholder.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dsZ5hTqk9YtgS.gif", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/5a/29/a2/38/95d5/4f29/b651/149229562bb3/president-barack-obamadr-katharine-hayhoe-and-leonardo-dicaprio-talk-climate-change.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=650", "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/assets/logo_desktop.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&dpr=2&w=246"], "top_img": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?rect=0%2C509%2C2048%2C1026&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inverse.com/article/21717-leonardo-dicaprio-barack-obama-elon-musk-mars-trio-sxsl", "title": "Leonardo DiCaprio Tells President Obama That He's Going to Mars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "description": "During a conversation at the White House's South by South Lawn event, actor Leonardo DiCaprio said he signed up for Elon Musk's deadly Mars trip.", "keywords": "Mars,Climate Crisis,Elon Musk,Politics,SpaceX,Short,Entertainment,Life in Space", "twitter": {"image": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?rect=0%2C509%2C2048%2C1026&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1200", "title": "Leonardo DiCaprio Says He Signed Up for Elon Musk's Deadly Mars Trip", "description": "At least that's what he told President Barack Obama.", "site": "@inversedotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.inverse.com/article/21717-leonardo-dicaprio-barack-obama-elon-musk-mars-trio-sxsl", "image": {"identifier": "https://fsmedia.imgix.net/a3/67/17/8e/b1f6/4e31/8ef5/95924aa55c52/leonardo-dicaprio-said-hes-going-to-mars.png?rect=0%2C509%2C2048%2C1026&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=1200", "type": "image/png"}, "title": "Leonardo DiCaprio Says He Signed Up for Elon Musk's Deadly Mars Trip", "description": "At least that's what he told President Barack Obama.", "site_name": "Inverse", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_at": "2016-10-04T00:41:00.000000Z", "modified_at": "2019-06-03T21:06:53.815044Z", "category": "Life in Space", "tag": "Life in Space", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inverse"}, "author": "James Grebey", "fb": {"pages": 820406651341117, "app_id": 1452605975051281}, "parsely-post-id": "62144d2d-cf19-42aa-8d98-89839384e3d5", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "theme-color": "#231f20", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Inverse"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.inverse.com", "summary": ""}
