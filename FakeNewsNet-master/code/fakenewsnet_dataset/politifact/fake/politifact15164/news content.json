He said he ran out of time \u201cnecessary to mount a winning campaign\u201d while mourning the loss of his son, Beau, to cancer.\n\nBiden spoke publicly before the election about his post-White House plans, which include working on his cancer moonshot initiative, a possible policy project with a major university and writing a book.\n\nThe vice president was at the Capitol on Monday afternoon to preside over the Senate as it held a vote on legislation funding the cancer initiative, a portion of which the chamber named after Beau.\n\nHe would have to put that work aside if he decided to launch a presidential bid in four years.\n\nThe vice president has long had his eye on the Oval Office. He ran for president in 1988 and again in 2008, losing both times in his party\u2019s primary.\n\nIn the past few months, he has repeatedly refused to rule out a future run for office. He told CNN in October his decision not to run in 2016 was solely because of his son\u2019s death.\n\n\"I didn't run for one simple overarching reason. My son was dying and he died,\" Biden said. \"I didn't not run because Hillary\u2019s running. I didn't run because my son's not here.\u201d", "images": ["http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-big.png", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/media_whitehouse_080919as_lead.jpg?itok=Rq71Vx72", "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/sandersbernie_052317gn2_lead.jpg?itok=omNKCCf-", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/bernie-sanders-at-podium-getty.jpg?itok=b2JEXD0n", "http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-footer.png", "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/clintonhillary_101916gn_lead.jpg?itok=B3AhAzh1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10314615&c3=&c4=https%3A//thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-51dZx4IkAE4Zk.gif", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/20191219_bidenjoe_gettyimages.jpg?itok=w3eO88O9", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/biden.joe_.1122.jpg", "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/mcconnellmitch_080117gn4_lead.jpg?itok=xX8bn44B", "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/leading_video/public/buttigiegpete_120819getty.jpg?itok=gT3_pqCX", "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_100/public/trumpdonald_070117getty.jpg?itok=9AUlbYFH"], "top_img": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/biden.joe_.1122.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid", "title": "Biden raises possibility of 2020 presidential bid", "meta_data": {"author": "Jordan Fabian", "description": "Vice President Biden\u00a0on Monday\u00a0raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am going to run in 2020,\u201d Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future.", "keywords": ",Hillary Clinton, Mitch McConnell, Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "fb": {"admins": 1531470032, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": "7533944086,2064147433830888"}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "type": "article", "title": "Biden raises possibility of 2020 presidential bid", "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid", "description": "Vice President Biden\u00a0on Monday\u00a0raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am going to run in 2020,\u201d Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future.", "updated_time": "2016-12-06T10:25:41-05:00", "image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/biden.joe_.1122.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Biden raises possibility of 2020 presidential bid", "url": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid", "description": "Vice President Biden\u00a0on Monday\u00a0raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am going to run in 2020,\u201d Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future.", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-12-05T19:12:45-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-12-06T10:25:41-05:00"}, "dcterms.title": "Biden raises possibility of 2020 presidential bid", "dcterms.creator": "Cyra Master", "dcterms.description": "Vice President Biden\u00a0on Monday\u00a0raised the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI am going to run in 2020,\u201d Biden told a group of reporters in the Capitol when asked about his political future.", "dcterms.date": "2016-12-05T19:12-05:00", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.identifier": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/308895-biden-raises-possibility-of-2020-presidential-bid", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1480983165.0, "source": "http://thehill.com", "summary": ""}
