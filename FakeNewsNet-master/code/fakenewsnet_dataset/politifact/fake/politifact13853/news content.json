A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.", "images": ["https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/climberyeti-350x199.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/background-1.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/logo-2.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mailboxmidget-350x199.jpg", "http://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "http://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/police-missouri.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mapdickpick-350x199.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png"], "top_img": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "De Soto, Missouri - Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when | Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "description": "De Soto, Missouri - Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when | Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "url": "https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/", "site_name": "News And Entertainment", "updated_time": "2017-06-20T19:22:21+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "secure_url": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "width": 680, "height": 354}}, "article": {"tag": "meth", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-01-21T15:47:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-20T19:22:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "De Soto, Missouri - Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when | Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "image": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1453391265.0, "source": "https://notallowedto.com", "summary": ""}
