The Daily Caller first drew attention to the calls.\n\n\u201cICE operates as an unaccountable deportation force,\u201d Fallon tweeted. \u201cDems running in 2020 should campaign on ending the agency in its current form.\u201d\n\nThomas Homan, the acting director of ICE, has reacted to these calls by Democrats by saying they should speak to victims of illegal immigrant crime.\n\n\u201cThese politicians, they need to talk to the victims of alien crime, talk to the parents that I talk to that lost children at the hands of criminal aliens,\u201d Homan said Thursday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cTucker Carlson Tonight.\u201d\n\nBut the idea has picked up steam in recent days after Hayes, the MSNBC host, asked Democratic California Sen. Kamala Harris if she believes ICE should exist.\n\n\u201cICE has a purpose, ICE has a role, ICE should exist,\u201d Harris, a potential 2020 candidate, responded. \u201cBut let\u2019s not abuse the power.\u201d\n\nSince then, Harris, the former attorney general of California, has faced a backlash from liberal publications.\n\n\u201cKamala Harris is very likely running for president in 2020,\u201d Jack Mirkinson of the liberal Splinter website wrote. \u201cIt should be a political problem for her that she is not willing to take her criticisms of ICE to their logical conclusion and call for its abolition.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cShe should be asked, over and over again, why exactly she is willing to uphold the legitimacy of such a racist, corrupt, and thuggish organization.\u201d\n\nMirkinson wrote that other potential candidates -- like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti -- \u201cshould be asked the same question.\u201d\n\nPELOSI SLAMS CALIFORNIA ICE RAID AS \u2018UNJUST AND CRUEL\u2019\n\nThe Nation, a liberal magazine, last week also published an article titled \u201cIt\u2019s Time to Abolish ICE.\u201d The writer accused the agency of being part of an \u201cunbridled white-supremacist surveillance state\u201d and called it \u201can unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough the party has moved left on core issues -- from reproductive rights to single-payer health care -- it\u2019s time for progressives to put forward a demand that deportation be taken not as the norm, but rather as a disturbing indicator of authoritarianism,\u201d McElwee wrote.\n\nDemocratic officeholders also have been openly rebelling against ICE, including Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who recently tipped off the public to an immigration raid in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last week slammed that raid as \"unjust and cruel.\"\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, in a speech in California last week, said as many as 800 illegal immigrants may have evaded capture and said Schaff\u2019s tip-off put both residents and law enforcement at risk.\n\nSESSIONS UNLOADS ON CALIFORNIA DEMS FOR \u2018RADICAL, OPEN BORDERS AGENDA\u2019\n\nSessions called California\u2019s \"open borders\" policies a \u201cradical, irrational idea that cannot be accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be the policy of a great nation to reward those who unlawfully enter its country with legal status, Social Security, welfare, food stamps, and work permits and so forth,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can this be a sound policy?\u201d", "images":
