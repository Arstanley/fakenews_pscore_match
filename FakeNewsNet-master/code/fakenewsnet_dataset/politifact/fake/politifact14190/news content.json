The Marines will now fall under the newly created Department of Expeditionary Warfare.\n\nSince 1834 The Marines have fallen under the Department of the Navy. This has always been a thorn in the side of Marines and naturally a source of ridicule from other branches. In 1834 Congress passed the Act for the Better Organization of the Marine Corps, stipulating that the Corps was part of the Department of the Navy as a sister service. The Marines will improve their amphibious attack readiness, and will continue to use the Navy for transportation to be the \u201cFirst to Fight\u201d.\n\nThe Marines will have an entirely new ROE and mission. Marine units that don\u2019t accomplish the mission within the 2 month window will be reassigned by the Marine Corps, and will have to watch as another unit finishes the job. \u201cThe Marine Corps is a competitive place, we have no room or respect for weak bitches that can\u2019t get in there fast, kill everyone, and get back to the ships in time to get to make the port calls in Asia.\u201d Sgt Major Garrett explained.\n\nThe move is mainly sentimental since the President has a clear love of The Marines and their traditions. \u201cThe Marines have dedicated their lives to the service of this country and have served at the pleasure of the President for many, many years and it\u2019s about time they be recognized as a separate department. They are the President\u2019s own and shall remain as such.\u201d President Trump explained.", "images": ["http://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-icons-widget/icons/medium/instagram.jpg", "https://no-cache.hubspot.com/cta/default/2565357/0bf02946-1243-444d-8e4b-32cec2386db5.png", "http://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-icons-widget/icons/medium/facebook.jpg", "http://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/plugins/social-media-icons-widget/icons/medium/youtube.jpg", "https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2565357/trump%20marines.jpg", "https://www.veterantv.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/VET-Television-logo-blank-back-white-300x169.png", "https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bro-love-80x80.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1347215522010472&ev=PageView&noscript=1&cd[domain]=www.veterantv.com", "https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/covfefe-80x69.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1347215522010472&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1347215522010472&ev=GeneralEvent&noscript=1&cd[post_type]=post&cd[content_name]=Trump+Removing+Marines+From+the+Navy&cd[post_id]=3384&cd[content_category]=Featured%2C+Satire&cd[domain]=www.veterantv.com", "https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-marines.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-marines.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jesse James"], "canonical_link": "https://www.veterantv.com/trump-removing-marines-from-the-navy/", "title": "Trump Removing Marines From the Navy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trump Removing Marines From the Navy", "description": "President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of", "url": "https://www.veterantv.com/trump-removing-marines-from-the-navy/", "site_name": "VET Tv", "updated_time": "2017-06-27T11:19:42-08:00", "image": "https://www.veterantv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/trump-marines.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/veterantelevision", "section": "Featured", "published_time": "2017-05-25T16:45:14-08:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-27T11:19:42-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "President Trump will sign executive order 13801 this November 10th on the 242nd birthday of the Marine Corps, freeing the Marines from the Department of The Navy.
