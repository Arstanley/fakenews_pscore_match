When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room.\n\n\u201cThe thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,\u201d said Chief Garner. \u201cApparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.\u201d\n\nNo one from Walmart\u2019s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were \u201cdisappointed\u201d that they weren\u2019t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/logo.png", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/themes/empire-news/images/arrow-nxt.png", "http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AD-Square-01.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pence-150x150.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/twitter.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/themes/empire-news/images/arrow-pre.png", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/trumpoh-150x150.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/linkedin.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walmart-crop.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/facebook.jpg"], "top_img": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walmart-crop.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bob The Empire News Potato"], "canonical_link": "https://empirenews.net/police-discover-meth-lab-in-back-room-of-alabama-walmart/", "title": "Police Discover Meth Lab In Back Room of Alabama Walmart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Empire News", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://empirenews.net/police-discover-meth-lab-in-back-room-of-alabama-walmart/", "keywords": "alabama, walmart, headlines, weird news, post", "article_published_time": "2017-03-30T22:48:13+00:00", "article_modified_time": "2017-03-30T22:48:13+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_author_name": "Bob The Empire News Potato", "site_id": "76243683f49863b3ff8e5df0254b974d", "wp_version": "8.13.10", "image": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walmart-crop-300x170.jpg"}, "og": {"image": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walmart-crop.jpg", "title": "Police Discover Meth Lab In Back Room of Alabama Walmart"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "fb": {"app_id": 227412004135680}, "ca_title": "Police Discover Meth Lab In Back Room of Alabama Walmart", "ca_image": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walmart-crop-150x150.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://empirenews.net", "summary": ""}
