Bush has lobbed thinly-veiled critiques of President Donald Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. | AP Photo Former presidents walk fine line in Trump\u2019s America Trump's predecessors are trying to both defend their legacies and respect the unwritten rule of not undermining the current commander in chief.\n\nDuring his \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d inaugural address, President Donald Trump sent a clear message: all of the presidents in recent memory have failed the American people.\n\nThe harsh rhetoric of Trump\u2019s inaugural address made an impression on his predecessors, with George W. Bush reportedly calling it \u201csome weird s--t\u201d and Jimmy Carter saying he \u201cflinched\u201d when Trump appeared to back off America's commitment to human rights.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn Trump\u2019s America, the five living former presidents are walking a fine line, attempting to defend their legacies while also trying to respect the \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that former presidents avoid undermining their successors.\n\n\u201cThe immediate former presidents have been more active in their criticism of the current president,\u201d George C. Edwards, a presidential historian at Texas A&M, said. \u201cThis kind of thing has been going on throughout history, but normally it\u2019s not very much. This is very early in a tenure and to have former presidents being critical of the president\u2026 is pretty unusual.\u201d\n\nAs Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about Trump. However, he\u2019s made his displeasure clear.\n\nObama, who campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton, said he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the protests following Trump\u2019s immigration ban targeting Muslim-majority countries. He also released a lengthy statement defending the Affordable Care Act against Trump\u2019s attempts to repeal it.\n\nAt a speech in Boston on Sunday night, Obama avoided mentioning Trump by name, but again forcefully defended his signature health care legislation and mentioned immigration reform. \u201cI expect to be busy, if not with a second career, at least a second act,\u201d Obama said Sunday.\n\nAnd on Monday, Obama\u2019s aides aggressively pushed back against Trump for trying to blame his predecessor for the woes associated with Trump\u2019s disgraced former national security adviser Michael Flynn. While Trump and White House press secretary Sean Spicer have repeatedly denounced Obama for not revoking Flynn\u2019s security clearance, Obama aides told reporters that Obama tried to warn Trump about Flynn\u2019s erratic nature.\n\nGeorge W. Bush, meanwhile, has lobbed thinly veiled critiques of Trump on his approach to the press and the travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries. \u201cI consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,\u201d Bush said in an interview with \u201cToday\u201d in February. \u201cWe need an independent media to hold people like me to account.\u201d\n\nAs for the travel ban, Bush was restrained but clear in his concern. \u201cI am for an immigration policy that's welcoming and upholds the law,\u201d Bush said.\n\nCarter also voiced concerns after Trump\u2019s inauguration. During an early April appearance at Emory University, he said he wanted to avoid addressing politics but he hoped the women\u2019s movement would be \u201cinvigorated\u201d by Trump and that he didn\u2019t see \u201cany glimmer of hope\u201d from the administration on race and gender issues.\n\nBill Clinton, who was harshly critical of Trump during the Manhattan businessman\u2019s presidential campaign, didn\u2019t mince words about Trump when he ran into a local newspaper editor while holiday shopping. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know much,\u201d Clinton said in late December. \u201cOne thing he does know is how to get angry white men to vote for him.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush, who has been in and out of the hospital, remains the only living president to avoid any political commentary.\n\nCriticism of the current president by former presidents is not completely unprecedented, however. For example, Herbert Hoover criticized Franklin D. Roosevelt, his successor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some criticism already of the incumbent president, but that\u2019s not really unprecedented,\u201d Tim Naftali, a presidential historian at New York University, said. \u201cIf it continues at a drumbeat from former presidents, then it will be something new.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former aides to the living former presidents say their former bosses are careful in criticizing the current occupant of the West Wing. Stuart Eizenstat, Carter\u2019s chief domestic policy adviser and a former ambassador, said it usually takes an extraordinary occurrence for a former president to criticize a sitting president.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a recognition that there is something so unique and special about the presidency, that, notwithstanding what might be very deep and serious policy differences and personal understandings, you simply bite your tongue,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t try to undercut the president because you know what impact that would have had when you were president.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Former aides say particularly on foreign policy issues, previous presidents and statesmen can be a valuable resource.\n\n\u201cMost of the time President Clinton reached out to former heads of state, or people like Henry Kissinger or James Baker, they were usually foreign policy issues, where you had a perspective there that was pretty unique on dealing with a similar situation,\u201d Mack McLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, said.\n\nFor example, Carter worked with former President Gerald Ford on the treaties which turned control of the Panama Canal over to Panama. Eizenstat said Carter instructed negotiator Sol Linowitz to call Ford immediately after the deal was ratified.\n\nOthers primarily use their predecessors for humanitarian trips. Harry Truman famously sent Hoover to address the post-World War II famine, and George W. Bush had his father and Clinton help with relief efforts for the tsunami in Southeast Asia and Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Obama sent the younger Bush and Clinton to Haiti to help after the 2010 earthquake.\n\n\u201cWhat would be really unusual is if no former president undertook any missions on behalf of the incumbent president,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cIf we see that none of the former presidents want anything to do with the Trump administration, that would be a first in the modern history of the American presidency.\u201d\n\nAll in all, most presidents have made an effort to remain engaged socially with their predecessors. Clinton and H.W. Bush are particularly close despite their hard-fought 1992 election, with Clinton tweeting pictures of the two in April.\n\nBut Trump is no normal president. Trump, who rose politically for questioning the legitimacy of his predecessor, at first appeared to have forged a working relationship with Obama, receiving advice both in person and over the phone. Obama even said he was \u201cencouraged\u201d by their first post-election meeting.\n\nTrump has since leveled unfounded wiretapping accusations against Obama, and the president abruptly ended a recent interview with CBS\u2019 John Dickerson after Dickerson pressed him on his comments about Obama.\n\n\u201cHe was very nice to me, but after that, we've had some difficulties,\u201d Trump said before referencing his debunked wiretapping allegation and saying that the alleged wiretapping was \u201cinappropriate.\u201d\n\nAs Barack Obama returns to the public spotlight, his former aides have made it clear he has no intention of talking much about President Donald Trump. | AP Photo\n\nHistorically speaking, Trump\u2019s relationship with the living former presidents is more fraught than any of his predecessors\u2019 had been, Laura Belmonte, a presidential historian at Oklahoma State University, said. \u201cThat one I think may be a category where Trump is on his own,\u201d she said\n\nAnd Trump hasn\u2019t shied away from criticizing those who came before him. As president, Trump called Obama a \u201cbad (or sick) guy!\u201d as part of his debunked wire-tapping claim. He called George W. Bush \u201cnot nice\u201d during the campaign, said the Bush administration \u201clied\u201d about the Iraq War and called Bill Clinton \u201cthe WORST abuser of women in U.S. political history.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush and Carter weren\u2019t excluded from Trump\u2019s slights. \u201cEnough is Enough- No More Bushses!\u201d Trump tweeted during the campaign. He also criticized Carter as unpresidential for carrying his own luggage.\n\nSteven Hochman, an aide to Carter at the Carter Center who helped the 92-year-old former president write his memoirs, said Carter hopes he and his center will be able to work with the Trump administration.\n\nAnd Carter hasn't always seized opportunities to knock Trump. The former president appeared with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) Monday to discuss human rights, and \u2014 while revealing that he voted for Sanders \u2014 Carter said the \"downturn\" of human rights \"preceded 2016.\"\n\n\u201cPresident Carter, I think he hopes that he won\u2019t need to speak out but I would assume that if there were something he needed to say, he would say it,\u201d Hochman said. \u201cActually, I\u2019m sure he would.\u201d\n\nBoth Bushes are more focused on their nonprofit work than engaging in politics, said Samuel Skinner, who served as the senior Bush's chief of staff. He\u2019s spoken to both since the inauguration, and neither has mentioned Trump.\n\n\u201cThey may have personal opinions, but they\u2019re not going to express them,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cBoth 41 and 43 are very measured people, so I think they\u2019ve been both very cautious about what they say.\u201d\n\nMcLarty, Clinton\u2019s former chief of staff, predicted his former boss will continue to weigh in on the politics of the day. \u201cI wouldn't be surprised at all if he expresses serious differences of opinion on economic, domestic and international policies,\u201d he said.\n\nGetting seriously involved in politics is a no-win scenario for former presidents, Skinner said, adding that the legacies of the former presidents are being shaped by historians, not today\u2019s events in Washington.\n\n\u201cI think any time and energy they have could be better spent working in nonprofits and their libraries,\u201d he said.", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://static.politico.com/a9/3f/a736e04646d0a343e231126e5532/170508-george-w-bush-ap-17059623005115.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/76973dd/2147483647/resize/1160x%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa9%2F3f%2Fa736e04646d0a343e231126e5532%2F170508-george-w-bush-ap-17059623005115.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.politico.com/a9/3f/a736e04646d0a343e231126e5532/170508-george-w-bush-ap-17059623005115.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martin Matishak", "Austin Wright", "Nolan D.
