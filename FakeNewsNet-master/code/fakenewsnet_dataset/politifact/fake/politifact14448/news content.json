While they have been throwing around claims that the white supremacist who ran over a protester who was blocking the road is a Republican, D\u2019Souza discovered he actually an Obama-supporting Democrat.\n\nWell, well. The white supremacist organizer of #Charlottesville was an Obama supporter & Occupy Wall Street activist https://t.co/hI5PxNUmb7 \u2014 Dinesh D'Souza (@DineshDSouza) August 15, 2017\n\n\u201cRumors abound on white nationalist forums that Kessler\u2019s ideological pedigree before 2016 was less than pure and seem to point to involvement in the Occupy movement and past support for President Obama,\u201d the Southern Poverty Law Center notes in their profile of Kessler.\n\nKessler didn\u2019t just support Obama; he visited the Oval Office in 2016. Here\u2019s a photo of the two of them having a fun chat:\n\nThe Democrat party wants you to forget they are the party of the KKK. The Democrat party wants you to blame Republicans. But let\u2019s remember that socialism is inherently a leftist ideology. Nazis \u2014 National Socialists \u2014 are leftist, pure and simple.\n\nThe Left has no shame in their attempt to link Donald Trump, who repudiated the attacker immediately after the murder occurred, to white supremacists but perhaps they should remember their own party\u2019s history\u2026and its present.\n\nSource: ourlandofthefree.com\n\nUpdate\n\nFake image?\n\nThe picture of Jason Kessler and Barry O. Bummer in the article above is apparently photoshopped. Original picture:\n\nPresident Trump Destroys Everyone at His Wild Press Conference in Trump Tower 8/15/17\n\nBusted! Journos Rush To Spread Fake News Following Trump\u2019s Latest Press Conference\n\nDonald Trump gave a speech addressing the violence this past weekend in Charlottesville.\n\nDuring his speech, the President asked if the \u201calt-left\u201d bore as much responsibility for the chaos as its extremist counterparts on the alt-right. Following the publication of an erroneous transcript, journalists and liberal pundits are spreading fake news about what Trump actually said in a rush to condemn him.\n\nPolitico\u2019s White House reporter Annie Karni was among the first to falsely highlight that Trump had referred to the alt-right as \u201cus\u201d in his speech. \u201cJust noticed the use of \u2018us\u2019 in this transcript,\u201d wrote Karni in a now-deleted tweet.\n\n\u201cOkay, what about the alt-left that came charging at us?\u201d she wrongly quoted the president as saying\n\nSpeaking to the press, Trump stated that members of the \u201calt-left\u201d (which is commonly understood to be made up of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and other social justice groups) were equally responsible for violence as their alt-right counterparts.\n\nIn the speech, Trump clearly says \u201cOkay, what about the alt-left that came charging at \u2018em?\u201d\n\n.@realDonaldTrump gave the media DAYS to call out the antifa, BLM, etc Instead the #FakeNews covered for them\u2026today it blew up on them. pic.twitter.com/QqDgwenIZD \u2014 Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) August 15, 2017\n\nAs Karni\u2019s tweet made the rounds on Twitter, some\u2014including CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter cast some doubt on the transcript. \u201cTranscript may be funky,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOthers, like New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman, were less discerning and more eager to spread the fake news to thousands of her followers.\n\nHaberman corrected herself after dozens of people who listened to the clip pointed out the falsehood.\n\nDespite her corrections, variations of the fake news continued to circulate on Twitter as some. One user, Brian Klaas, jumped to erroneous conclusions and wondered if Trump had made a Freudian slip. \u201cTrump lumps himself with his white supremacist supporters,\u201d wrote Klaas in a now-deleted tweet.\n\nThe fake news stems from Politico\u2019s inaccurate transcription of Donald Trump\u2019s speech. A snapshot of the transcript on Archive.is reveals the presence of the fake quote.\n\nThe updated version of the transcript fixed the error, but did not acknowledge that any edits were made. Following complaints on Twitter, the transcript has been updated with a correction at the bottom.\n\n\u201cIn a review of the audio, we could not definitively discern Trump\u2019s exact words at that moment in the news conference,\u201d the site claims. Rather puzzlingly, Politico had no problem peppering \u201cREPORTERS YELL INDISTINCTLY\u201d throughout the piece.", "images":
