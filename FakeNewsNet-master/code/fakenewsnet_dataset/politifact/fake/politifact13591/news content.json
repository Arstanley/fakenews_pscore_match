It seems like a harmless ointment, effective for fever, nasal congestion, and many other affections.\n\nBut this case will make people question its use, especially moms and dads with small children because it could bring fatal consequences to them.\n\nA mother tells her tragedy to warn other parents and avoid someone else going through what she\u2019s living: the loss of her 2-years-old baby.\n\nWhen she came back from work, she came into her baby\u2019s room. When she got near to kiss him, she felt he had a fever. She imagined it was just a common cold and thought about a home remedy to relieve him.\n\nShe rubbed Vick VapoRub on his chest, back, and under his nose to help him breathe. She tucked him up and laid down next to him.\n\nShe was tired, so she fell asleep next to her baby. Hours later, when she woke up, she noticed her son wasn\u2019t breathing.\n\nShe carried him and took it to the hospital to save him. But, sadly, everything was pointless, the baby had been dead for hours.\n\nThe medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment.\n\nShe never imagined that home remedy would take his baby. She only wanted to help him breathe, and the ointment did exactly the opposite.\n\nThe thing is, this remedy is effective for adults; however, for babies younger than two years old, the ointment increases the mucus by 60%. The mucus accumulates on the trachea and blocks the breathing.\n\nThe label warns the ointment is contraindicated for children younger than 3 years old.\n\nSadly, in the case of the mother, the warning went unnoticed. Using home remedies for several affections is something common in homes around the world, but we hope this story draw attention to this fact: when children are concerned, we must always read the labels and ask for the advice of experts before using any home remedy.\n\nWe must not let a simple mistake take our loved ones; we must be careful and seek medical advice to treat any illness.", "images": ["https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/smag.jpg", "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/love-1111816_1280-150x150.jpg", "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/15337384_1222194804534148_9030918027401594581_n-150x150.png", "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzc5ODdlM2I5NWMyYzJhNDQxM2MxMDZkMDY3MTU5OTIwLmpwZw.prx_.4c5e33ae.jpg", "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/kqf4hj0clwi-seth-doyle-150x150.jpg", "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzE0ZjcyY2FhZjJmOTA4NTczMzYyYWU4ZWUzOTQ1OTgyLmpwZw.prx_.ca7c6ddb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzE0ZjcyY2FhZjJmOTA4NTczMzYyYWU4ZWUzOTQ1OTgyLmpwZw.prx_.ca7c6ddb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://smag31.com/mom-applies-a-remedy-to-her-baby-moments-later-he-dies/", "title": "Mom applies vapo rub on her baby, moments later he dies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mom applies vapo rub on her baby, moments later he dies", "description": ".", "url": "https://smag31.com/mom-applies-a-remedy-to-her-baby-moments-later-he-dies/", "site_name": "Smag31", "updated_time": "2019-12-04T10:37:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/chncdhaHR0cHM6Ly9wZXJmZWN0by5ndXJ1L3dwLWNvbnRlbnQvdXBsb2Fkcy8yMDE2LzExLzE0ZjcyY2FhZjJmOTA4NTczMzYyYWU4ZWUzOTQ1OTgyLmpwZw.prx_.ca7c6ddb.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 450}}, "article": {"section": "Parenting", "published_time": "2016-11-25T16:40:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-12-04T10:37:24+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1392242714366377}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://smag31.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1480092005.0, "source": "http://smag31.com", "summary": ""}
