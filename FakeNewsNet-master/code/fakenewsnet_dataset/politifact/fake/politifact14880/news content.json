He converted to Islam two years ago.\n\nHowever, what those reports don\u2019t mention is that the would-be terrorist also \u2018liked\u2019 numerous Antifa pages, suggesting he supported the movement.\n\nJameson liked Berkeley Antifa, Antifa California, Antifa Scaramento and White Rose Antifa Portland, an archived version of his Facebook profile confirms.\n\nHe also liked a number of other far-left pages, including \u2018Trump Resistance Movement\u2019, \u2018Things Trump Supporters Say\u2019, \u2018US Democratic Socialists\u2019, \u2018Progressive Politics\u2019, and \u2018Jeremy Corbyn\u2019.\n\nSome of Jameson\u2019s favorite news organisations were The Young Turks, CNN, BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera. He also liked a number of pro-vegan pages.\n\nThe jihadist also sympathised with a number of pro-Muslim pages, including \u2018Documenting Oppression Against Muslims, \u2018Islam \u2013 Religion of Peace\u2019 and \u2018Stunning Hijabs\u2019, as well as numerous anti-Israel activist pages.\n\nJameson\u2019s Facebook likes confirm that his political leanings were a mixture of radical far-left ideology and Islamism.\n\nAs we have documented, ISIS has previously attempted to reach out to those on the far-left as part of an attempt to create militant offshoot cells within the United States and Western Europe.\n\nA passage from the ISIS manifesto Black Flags from Rome entitled \u2018European Muslims allying with Left-Wing activists\u2019 details a plan to recruit those on the far left because they broadly share the same goals as radical Islamists.\n\nDuring the anti-Trump inauguration riots back in January, one Antifa supporter was seen displaying an ISIS flag and beheading videos on his phone in an effort to intimidate Trump supporters in Washington, DC.\n\nAccording to a recently revealed FBI field report, Antifa supporters have stored improvised explosives on college campuses. Members of Antifa have also met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training.\n\nFBI field report: Antifa has improvised explosives stored on college campuses. Members of Antifa have met with Islamic terrorists to obtain weapons & training. This is why the DHS now lists Antifa as a terror group. pic.twitter.com/TkbL3BRCgu \u2014 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 30, 2017\n\nAntifa radicals are meeting with ISIS.
