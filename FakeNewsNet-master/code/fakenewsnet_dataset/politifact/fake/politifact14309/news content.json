Either rising sea temperatures and depleted fish stocks possibly led the shark to adventure itself further into the Great Lakes region.\u201d he admits, visibly puzzled. \u201cIt is also possible it traveled to the region through underwater tunnels that interconnect between the Great Lakes,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nAccording to authorities more than a hundred people reported missing in the area in the last decade may have fallen under the fangs of the gigantic beast, several local residents even suspecting its presence for a long time.\n\nU.S. Coast Guards reassured local residents that the occurrence of such a predator in the region\u2019s waters \u201cis highly unlikely\u201d as sharks are not well adapted to freshwater systems.\n\nIn 1916, a deadly shark attack near Presque Ile beach, in Lake Eerie, made national headlines, forcing local authorities to ban swimming in the region for over 14 years until the ban was lifted in 1930.", "images": ["https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/climberyeti-350x199.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/background-1.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg", "http://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/logo-2.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Mailboxmidget-350x199.jpg", "http://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan-2.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/mapdickpick-350x199.jpg"], "top_img": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/", "title": "3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing\u00a0people in the | 3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "description": "Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing\u00a0people in the | 3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "url": "https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/", "site_name": "News And Entertainment", "updated_time": "2017-06-20T19:21:23+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg", "secure_url": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 315}}, "article": {"tag": "shark", "section": "News", "published_time": "2016-06-21T13:41:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-20T19:21:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Waukegan, IL | The capture of a huge 3,000-pound great white shark in Lake Michigan yesterday could explain the disappearance of missing\u00a0people in the | 3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "title": "3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes", "image": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shark-michigan.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1466516497.0, "source": "https://notallowedto.com", "summary": ""}
