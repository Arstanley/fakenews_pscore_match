Those of us that criticize the so-called \u201creligion of peace\u201d are subjected to ridicule and even being attacked for our belief of how dangerous Muslims are. In Europe, those that speak out against Islam are being imprisoned for their belief. Courts are actually sentencing people for \u201cIslam anti-blasphemy\u201d laws. While this may be par for the course in Europe right now, it is not the way we roll in America, until now. Minnesota has just established a similar law.\n\nAnti-blasphemy laws are a huge victory for Muslims because it ensures their protection and in turn, allows them to continue acting in whatever manner they please all the while marching towards Sharia Law.\n\nAccording to Minneapolis\u2019 local newspaper, the Star-Tribune, the hotline was set up as a way to target Trump supporters, who Muslims believe are the group of people most likely to \u201charass them.\u201d The Star Tribune reported:\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has set up a hotline for residents to report hate-crime incidents and other acts of intolerance.\n\nThe service, operated through the city\u2019s 311 helpline, is aimed to aid targets of any \u201charassing behaviors motivated by prejudice,\u201d according to a city news release issued on Monday.\n\nThe announcement comes amid signs of a recent surge of such incidents affecting Muslims and Jews across the country, many of which go unreported.\n\n\u201cSince the general election, many of us have experienced, witnessed firsthand or heard of actions of: racism, xenophobia, sexism and bigotry directed at people here and in cities across the United States,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s Department of Civil rights along with mayor is leading the charge for this government-enforced fascism, as this new hotline will now encourage citizens to turn in their neighbors for holding opinions deemed forbidden by the state. This hotline flies right in the face of our United States Constitution, where it goes to the heart of denying American citizens their inalienable rights of the First Amendment, which governments CAN NOT DO. Of course, the rabid liberals controlling the city have little regard for the Constitution or the rights of Americans, as they are using their position to establish a soft version of anti-blasphemy laws. \u201cIn no uncertain terms, hate-motivated speech and actions have no place in Minneapolis nor will they be tolerated,\u201d Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights Director Velma Korbel wrote in a statement posted on the city\u2019s website.\n\nThe Department echoes the unconstitutional sentiments of Minneapolis\u2019 mayor, Betsy Hodges, who went on to blast President Trump, pushing her insane narrative of there being an epidemic of bigotry and hate in our country since he got into office. She stated: \u201cI will not compromise the public safety of the people of Minneapolis to satisfy Trump\u2019s desire to put politics before public safety. Minneapolis is being built and strengthened by people from all over the world and I am grateful for their commitment to our city. I stand with them today and will continue to take that stand as the President-elect prepares to take office.\u201d The idea of an anti-blasphemy hotline in America is pretty absurd, but right up liberal\u2019s alley. Why are they so willing to protect those that would seek to hurt us, don\u2019t they want to protect their loved ones? This is only the beginning of the Democrats plans to take control of our country again, but what they don\u2019t realize is that everyone will end up suffering if we continue to bow to Muslim\u2019s demands. This \u201canti-blasphemy\u201d hotline is just the start and will only get worse if we allow it. It is very similar to Nazi Germany\u2019s approach in the 1930\u2019s when they started to purge out anyone who was perceived as a threat. Trying to normalize the concept of turning in your neighbor for their opinion is nothing short of chilling and should be looked at as a major threat to our freedom. What do you think?
