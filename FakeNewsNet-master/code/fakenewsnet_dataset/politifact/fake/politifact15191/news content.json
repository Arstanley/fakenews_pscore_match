If he went outside for the walkout, he said, he would be supporting gun control. If he stayed in the common area of the school, he said, he would be seen as supporting gun violence and disrespecting the 17 lives lost in the Parkland, Fla. High school shooting the month before.\n\nJacob had met with the school\u2019s principal on Tuesday, a day before the rally, for about an hour to find out what exactly the walkout was supporting. But he said the principal reportedly told him it was for the \u201cstudents to express themselves.\u201d\n\nCOLLEGE STUDENT KICKED OUT OF CLASS FOR TELLING PROFESSOR THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS\n\nThis left Jacob wondering if it was a memorial for the lives lost or a show of support for gun control.\n\nHe decided, instead, to stay in class for about 20 minutes doing homework after his teacher and fellow classmates left and locked the door.\n\nWhen they returned, he was slapped with a suspension.\n\nJacob\u2019s father, Scott Shoemaker, said his son was just trying to stay neutral \u2013 and did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cPolitics [doesn\u2019t] belong in the school,\u201d he said. \u201cStudents shouldn\u2019t be pressured into taking a side.\u201d\n\nSTUDENT WITH \u2018TRUMP\u2019 FLAG ASSAULTED BY MOB DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUT\n\nThe story went viral after Jacob sent a photo of his out-of-school suspension citation to one of his friends, who posted it on social media.\n\nThe school, as well as the Shoemakers, have received death threats and hate messages.\n\nScott Shoemaker said his son was just trying to be introspective \u2013 and he wasn\u2019t acting out.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t do anything to deserve this,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask for this.\u201d\n\nCHICAGO STUDENTS ALLEGEDLY TRASH WALMART DURING NATIONAL SCHOOL WALKOUT PROTEST\n\nThe district says it's responsible for students' safety and they can't be unsupervised.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/17/931/524/694940094001_5753386463001_5753387880001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/ohio-school-suspension-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/15/694940094001_5751929083001_5751930141001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/calebparkeheadshot0622182.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/monsey-stabbing-clip.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/17/694940094001_5753386463001_5753387880001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/ACTCRAZY1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/TexasFire1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/12/270/152/bronx-attack.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/03/17/694940094001_5753386463001_5753387880001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
