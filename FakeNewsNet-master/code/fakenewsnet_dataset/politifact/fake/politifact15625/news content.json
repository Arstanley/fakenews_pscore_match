Ortiz-V\u00e9lez, a Democrat-alligned Puerto Rico mayor, is facing fraud charges relating to the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds, just months after Puerto Rican politicians appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.\n\nUpdate: This article, published on July 15 2018, originally alleged that San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz was the Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds. This was incorrect.\n\nAccording to a DOJ press release from July 5 of this year, it was the mayor of the municipality of Sabana Grande, Miguel G. Ortiz-V\u00e9lez, who had \u201cbeen indicted and arrested for his participation in a conspiracy to steal federal funds involving fraudulently obtained contracts from the PR Department of Education.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and huge amounts of money to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still openly criticized the president \u2014 and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the \u201cblame Trump\u201d narrative.\n\nAs comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWhat is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,\u201d Yul\u00edn Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled \u201cNASTY\u201d \u2014 where did she get it during a major storm? \u2014 as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.\n\nLiberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. \u201cWe are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,\u201d she said during a television conference in early October.\n\nWestern Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of \u201cinefficiency and bureaucracy\u201d in Puerto Rico \u2026 but it looks like the island\u2019s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.\n\nAlthough the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.\n\n\u201cThe suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,\u201d the AP reported.\n\n\u201cU.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town\u2019s public employees and municipal contractors,\u201d the newswire continued.\n\n\u201cNot only is that illegal, it\u2019s immoral,\u201d Rodriguez added.\n\nPuerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.\n\nAt the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz V\u00e9lez, who served as mayor. Ortiz V\u00e9lez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.\n\nGuess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?\n\nThere may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.\n\n\u201cRodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are involved,\u201d the AP confirmed.\n\nThe hurricane that devastated Puerto Rico was certainly a tragedy, and many lessons about disaster preparedness can be learned from that incident.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s abundantly clear that widespread corruption and incompetence in Puerto Rico was a major part of the chaos. That corruption doesn\u2019t point to Donald Trump \u2026 it leads right to the same leftist Democrats who were trying to point fingers the entire time.", "images": ["https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Trump-arrest-schiff-for-treason-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/robert-de-niro-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Clapper-ISIS-leaders-death-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/peter-strzok-cia-1-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ISIS-oil-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/fema-camps-80x60.jpeg.optimal.jpeg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Poland-facebook-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/pride-controversy3-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/woman-kills-father-pedo-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/tom-perez-80x60.jpeg.optimal.jpeg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blair-rats-on-obama-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/acid-reflux-drugs-stomach-cancer-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/peurto-rico-mayor-fraud-696x467.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/snopes-mikkelson-censoring-conservatives-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kasich-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jerry-brown-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/north-korea-sub-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Sharkinfested-Hawaii-meme-copy-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/war-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/peurto-rico-mayor-fraud.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/gravatar/6cae9ccd8c59189ae87b9eb3c62a3828.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rand-paul-hillary-collusion-russia-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/war-against-ISIS-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/news_punch_logo.png", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/camerontrust-gt-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/peurto-rico-mayor-fraud-678x381.jpg.optimal.jpg", "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/airstrikes-80x60.jpg.optimal.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newspunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/peurto-rico-mayor-fraud.jpg.optimal.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Baxter Dmitry"], "canonical_link": "https://newspunch.com/puerto-rico-mayor-fraud-disaster/", "title": "Puerto Rico Mayor Facing Fraud Charges Over Millions In Gov\u2019t Funds", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Miguel G.
