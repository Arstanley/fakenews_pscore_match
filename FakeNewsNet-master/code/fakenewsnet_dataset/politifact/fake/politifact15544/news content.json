On January 3, 2018, he met with a Project Veritas undercover journalist (UCJ) at Stookey's Club Moderne in San Francisco.\n\n\u00a9 Youtube James O\u2019Keefe went undercover to expose Twitter\n\nUsing a hidden video camera, the Veritas UCJ captures Haynes stating that \u201cwe\u2019re more than happy to help the DOJ with their little investigation\u201d of President Trump.\n\nWhen prompted by the UCJ, Mr. Haynes provides additional details, \u201cBasically, giving them every single tweet that he\u2019s posted.

Haynes\n\n\u201cThe fact is, even if Haynes was just speculating about helping Justice, his admission shows a clear and dangerous political bias at the highest levels of Twitter,\u201d says Project Veritas founder and President James O\u2019Keefe in the video.\n\n\u201cThe question is: by Twitter giving private information about the President to the Justice Department, are they breaking the law,

users.\n\nThe Project Veritas Twitter investigation is the fourth installment of its American Pravda series.\n\nIn Part I, Veritas disclosed that CNN's Russia coverage is driven by ratings and a political agenda, but in reality, using the words of CNN Political Commentator Van Jones is just a \u201cnothing burger.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Youtube Clay Haynes is a self-confessed 'bleeding-heart liberal'\n\nPart II disclosed a political bias at The New York Times which forced executive responses and an immediate change of their social media policy.\n\nPart III exposed political bias at The Washington Post and brought to light that the far-reaching narratives of the paper\u2019s editorial board are not rooted in the factual findings of their subject-matter expert reporters.\n\n\u00a9
