Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s Orange County home. The 15-term Republican greeted me in bare feet, sitting on his front step making fundraising phone calls while wearing a stained white T-shirt and khakis he bought at Goodwill. Later, he proudly showed me a blazer he scored there for $10.\n\nThen again, Ronald Reagan\u2019s 70-year-old former White House speech writer is a surreal kind of guy. He\u2019s a hero to weed-lovers for being a Republican at the forefront of the pro-marijuana legalization movement, and a pariah to fellow Republicans for being so pro-Russia that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy once jokingly said that \u201cPutin pays\u201d him. He wants to cut a deal with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and thinks the Charlottesville riots were staged by liberals and were \u201ca total hoax.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s both a puka-shell-necklace-wearing surfer and a fierce anti-Communist who bragged about battling with Afghan mujahedeen during a fact-finding trip shortly before being sworn into Congress that \u201cprobably resulted in the deaths of a number of Soviet troops.\u201d During our visit, he largely dismissed human influence on climate change and strummed a guitar whiling singing a song he wrote about libertarian ideals called \u201cIndividual Man.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re a Democrat, you\u2019re thinking, \u201cHow is this guy still holding office in California?\u201d\n\nStanding at the corner of Fringe and Conspiracy streets, Rohrabacher would seem to be easy picking for Democrats, who are making Orange County the centerpiece of their plan to return to power in the House by flipping 24 GOP seats. They\u2019re focused on districts like Rohrabacher\u2019s, where Hillary Clinton outpolled President Trump and the incumbents are perceived as out-of-touch.\n\nIt won\u2019t be that easy. Rohrabacher also stands squarely in the middle of the old school, wealthier, whiter, conservative, still- lovin\u2019-the-Gipper part of the OC. He\u2019s run for Congress 15 times, and he\u2019s won by more than 20 percent 13 times. Call him fringe-y, but he\u2019s conservative OC kind of fringe-y.\n\nThat\u2019s why, if next year turns out to be the kind of low-turnout, midterm election that favors Republicans, Orange County GOP chairman Fred Whitaker said he\u2019s \u201cnot worried about Dana at all.\u201d And it doesn\u2019t hurt that Republicans have an 11-point voter registration advantage in the 48th Congressional District.\n\nStill, Rohrabacher acknowledges, \u201cthis race will be the toughest.\u201d Not because Democrats are going after his seat and nine candidates have jumped in to oppose him, including two who are raising serious money. Because, he said, \u201cof Russia.\u201d\n\nRohrabacher describes himself as the lone voice against both conservatives and liberals who want retribution against Russia for meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But what about the \u201chigh confidence\u201d with which the nation\u2019s top intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the election?\n\n\u201cTotal bull\u2014,\u201d Rohrabacher said over peanut butter sandwiches \u2014 his favorite meal \u2014 that he slapped together in his kitchen. \u201cI\u2019ve read those reports and they\u2019re full of weasel words.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat story is a total fabrication in order to do one thing: To prevent Donald Trump from exercising the legitimate authority he was given by the voters in the last election,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of Rohrabacher\u2019s sources: Assange. Last summer, on his own dime, Rohrabacher visited Assange, who for years has been harbored in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, fearing extradition to Sweden on sexual assault accusations and bail-jumping charges in England.\n\nRohrabacher said Assange told him that Russia wasn\u2019t involved in the theft of emails from the Democratic National Committee that Wikileaks released, but didn\u2019t say who was. Maybe the emails fell off the back of a truck, as they used to say in my grandpa\u2019s neighborhood.\n\nRohrabacher isn\u2019t buying that conspiracy theory, but he\u2019s deep into another \u2014 that Democrats were behind last month\u2019s white nationalist riots in Charlottesville, Va. Oh, and calling them white nationalist riots is a liberal media deceit, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all baloney,\u201d Rohrabacher said.\n\nUnder Rohrabacher\u2019s scenario, a former \u201cHillary and Bernie supporter\u201d got Civil War re-enactors to gather under the guise of protecting a Robert E. Lee statue there.\n\n\u201cIt was a setup for these dumb Civil War re-enactors,\u201d Rohrabacher said. \u201cIt was left-wingers who were manipulating them in order to have this confrontation\u201d and to \u201cput our president on the spot.\u201d\n\nThose of you who are fans of conspiracy connoisseur and conservative commentator Alex Jones, host of \u201cInfo Wars,\u201d will recognize that scenario as one of his dreamscapes, which is \u201cPants on Fire\u201d groundless, according to the nonpartisan Politifact.\n\nMeanderings like that make Democrats see Rohrabacher as vulnerable. Several credible, well-financed Democrats, including world-renowned stem cell researcher Hans Keirstead, have lined up to take him on. Keirstead raised $138,504 shortly after jumping into the race, according to the latest federal filing information, and real estate investor Harley Rouda has raised $319,335. Three of the Democrats, including Rouda, were once Republicans, which could play well in the OC.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s an unprecedented amount of liberal grassroots activism in the district, with regular protests outside Rohrabacher\u2019s office. Progressives are trying to reintroduce the 24 percent of nonpartisan voters in the district to their congressman \u2014 and not in a good way.\n\n\u201cPeople saw \u2018incumbent\u2019 and an \u2018R\u2019 by his name, so they assumed that he supported Republican values,\u201d said Aaron McCall, who heads the local chapter of the resistance group Indivisible. \u201cDana Rohrabacher doesn\u2019t support Republican values. He supports his own values. Republicans tell me \u2018We didn\u2019t realize he was this unhinged.\u2019\u201d\n\nRohrabacher admits that part of him would like to just spend time working on screenplays, playing guitar and surfing with his wife and teenage triplets.\n\nBut he wants to stay in Congress to fight for the easing of cannabis laws and to advance his views on Russia, two lonely battles that he worries would be abandoned if he were gone.\n\nAnd that is what is making Rohrabacher do something he\u2019s rarely done in his career, something truly surreal. He\u2019s seriously trying to raise money for a re-election campaign \u2014 so far he\u2019s raised $508,712. In his bare feet, eating peanut butter sandwiches. After our chat, he headed out to the nearby 99 Cents Only store to get a refill.\n\nJoe Garofoli is The San Francisco Chronicle\u2019s senior political writer.
