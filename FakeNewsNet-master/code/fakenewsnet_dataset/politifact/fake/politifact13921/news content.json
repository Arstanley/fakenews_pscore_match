This means 3,389 whites have to go. It is part of the Federal \u201cBlack Empowerment\u201d program.\n\nFor years, Eskom has been under orders to only hire non-whites as new employees. The firm says it is having major problems finding enough qualified non-white applicants. Currently, Eskom\u2019s middle managers are 30% white and it\u2019s skilled labor force is 21% white.\n\nThe South African government has also ordered Eskom to reduce it\u2019s safety requirements to make it easier for non-white applicants to qualify for jobs.\n\nEskom is ordered to reduce the number of white engineers by 1,081, and the number of white skilled laborers by 2,179.\n\nSouth Africa is currently experiencing a rapid collapse of it\u2019s electrical infrastructure and power routinely goes out all over the country.\n\nSource (South Africa Channel 24)", "images": ["https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "https://i0.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/flag-ad-e1539697029436.jpg", "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=500%2C263"], "top_img": "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=500%2C263", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://conservative-headlines.com/2015/03/south-african-firm-ordered-to-lay-off-3389-white-employees/", "title": "South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees", "meta_data": {"keywords": "south africa", "description": "SA power company ordered to fire 3,389 whites, as roving blackouts sweep the nation", "og": {"url": "http://conservative-headlines.com/2015/03/south-african-firm-ordered-to-lay-off-3389-white-employees/", "title": "South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees", "description": "SA power company ordered to fire 3,389 whites, as roving blackouts sweep the nation", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=600%2C315", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "site_name": "Conservative Headlines", "locale": "en_US"}, "fb": {"app_id": 577223705644733}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-09T21:48:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-09T21:48:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "South African firm ordered to lay off 3,389 white employees"}, "image": "https://i2.wp.com/conservative-headlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/eskom.jpg?fit=600%2C315&w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1425937683.0, "source": "http://conservative-headlines.com", "summary": ""}
