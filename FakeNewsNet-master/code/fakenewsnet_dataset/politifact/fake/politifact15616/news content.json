They really beat him. It's appalling \u2014 like something you would see in a war zone,\" she said.\n\n\u201cHe looks terrible,\" she continues.\n\n\"His left eye is like a golf ball and bleeding, the nose looks like it could be broken.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t had an x-ray yet.\n\n\"He doesn\u2019t remember anything.\n\n\"The first thing he remembers is the police.\n\n\u201cHe is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions.\n\n\u201cNothing was taken, but the transport police intervened quickly.\n\n\"London is such a beautiful, wonderful city.\n\n\"We can't start worrying about walking in the streets at 3 pm.\"\n\n\u00a9 press The 74-year-old retired diplomat, pictured with his wife, was beaten to a pulp for his political view\n\nDaily Mail reports: Cambridge-educated Sir Christopher worked as press secretary for former chancellor Geoffrey Howe and John Major before being appointed US ambassador.\n\nHe spent six years in Washington, from 1997 to 2003, becoming the longest-serving holder of his office since 1945.\n\nAs ambassador, he welcomed around 35,000 guests to his home a year and was made Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George.\n\nAfter retiring, he became chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the former newspaper regulatory body.\n\nHe is a prolific tweeter, who regularly comments on politics and foreign affairs.\n\nThe former diplomat has called for Britain to engage with President Trump ahead of his visit today.\n\nHe has been married to Catherine for more than 20 years.\n\nSir Christopher's attack comes as London's crime rate has soared.\n\nSince the start of the year, more than 80 murder investigations have been launched in the capital.\n\nForces in England and Wales logged 5.3million crimes in the year to September 2017, 14 percent up on the previous 12 months.\n\nA statement from the British Transport Police (BTP) said:\n\n\"Officers were called to Victoria London Underground Station at 2.45pm yesterday (11 July), after receiving reports that a man had been seriously assaulted.\n\n\"A 16-year-old boy from Hillingdon and a 15-year-old girl from Croydon were both arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm.\n\n\"They have been released under investigation while inquiries into the incident continue.\n\n\"A man in his seventies was taken to hospital, though his injuries are not believed to be life-threatening or changing.\"\n\nThoughts with former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer, who was brutally attacked yesterday.
