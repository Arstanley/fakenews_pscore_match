According to the National Hurricane Center, Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour at one point on Tuesday. That makes it the strongest Atlantic hurricane in history \u201coutside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean\u201d. I was criticized for suggesting that Irma could become so powerful that it could potentially be labeled a \u201ccategory 6\u201d storm if such a thing existed. Well, now it has actually happened. If you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, \u201ccategory 6\u201d would begin at 158 knots, which would be 181.8 miles per hour. Since Irma has surpassed that mark, I believe that it is entirely reasonable if people want to refer to it as a \u201ccategory 6\u201d storm.\n\nOf course some meteorologists will get very heated with you when you use the term \u201ccategory 6\u201d because no such category exists at this point.\n\nBut we need some way to describe an Atlantic hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. \u201cCategory 5\u201d simply does not do such a storm justice, and yes, Hurricane Irma is the type of storm that could wipe entire cities off the map if it came ashore at this power.\n\nWe don\u2019t know where this immensely powerful storm will make landfall in the U.S. yet, but you don\u2019t want to be there when it does. I don\u2019t want to freak people out, but the truth is that the best thing you can do is to get as far away from this storm as you can.\n\nJust remember what happened in Houston. The people were told not to evacuate, and that turned out to be an absolutely disastrous decision.\n\nThis is not just another storm. This is a history making event, and if Irma slams directly into one of our major cities as a category 5 storm, it could potentially make Hurricane Harvey look like a Sunday picnic. The following are some of the key things that you need to know about Hurricane Irma\u2026\n\n#1 According to the Miami Herald, Hurricane Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour on Tuesday afternoon\u2026\n\nIrma continued to explode into a powerful storm Tuesday afternoon, with winds increasing to 185 mph, National Hurricane Center forecasters said in a 2 p.m. advisory. As the storm continued to track westward, islands in its path raced to complete last minute preparations. The Leeward Islands are expected to get hit with \u201ccatastrophic\u201d winds tonight, forecasters said, with the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico slammed tomorrow. In Puerto Rico, the governor asked President Donald Trump to declare a state of emergency, while the electric company warned Irma\u2019s fierce winds could leave the island without power for four to six months.\n\n#2 The NOAA is saying that Irma is \u201cthe strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic \u2014 outside the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico.\u201d\n\n#3 As mentioned above, if you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, Irma could be considered a category 6 storm\u2026\n\nWhile few are willing to admit it yet, according to meteorologist Ryan Maye, Hurricane Irma is still intensifying, with winds up to 155-knots (180 mph) and that extrapolating Saffir-Simpson scale, 158-knots would be Category 6.\n\nYes, I know that a \u201ccategory 6\u201d does not exist yet, but perhaps it is about time that scientists got together and updated the scale in light of the dangerous new realities that we are now facing.\n\n#4 Hurricane Irma is so enormously powerful that it is even \u201cshowing up on seismometers\u201d\u2026\n\nHurricane Irma is so strong it\u2019s showing up on seismometers \u2014 equipment designed to measure earthquakes. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the seismogram are low-pitched hums that gradually become stronger as the hurricane gets closer to the seismometer on the island of Guadeloupe,\u201d said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.\n\n#5 In all of U.S. history, only three category 5 hurricanes have ever hit the United States \u2013 an unnamed storm in 1935, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992.\n\n#6 A state of emergency has already been declared for every single county in the state of Florida.\n\n#7 If you are in the \u201cdanger zone\u201d and you have not already stockpiled food, water and supplies, it is probably already too late. Reports of \u201cpanic prepping\u201d are coming in from all over Florida, and down in Puerto Rico many stores are already out of all the most important supplies\u2026\n\nOn Tuesday, the lines for fast-dwindling gas, food, water and hardware were interminable and anxiety mounted. One hardware store in San Juan had been nearly picked clean by afternoon. \u201cThis has been like this for the last three days,\u201d said Juan Carlos Ramirez, the store manager. \u201cWe\u2019ve sold all of the most necessary items \u2014 flashlight, batteries, plywood.\u201d\n\nOne of my readers made the point the other day that this isn\u2019t the kind of storm that you can \u201cprepare\u201d for.\n\nAnd my reader was precisely correct. You can\u2019t \u201cget prepared\u201d for a hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. Such a storm will snap homes like toothpicks.\n\nIf I was in Florida, I would be heading north immediately. Those that wait could find themselves in absolutely nightmarish traffic jams.\n\nAnd if I lived on the Gulf coast, I would be watching this storm very, very carefully.\n\nBecause the waters in the Gulf of Mexico are so warm, there is the possibility that Irma could get even stronger if it slides to the south of Florida.\n\nLet us hope that it does not happen, but a scenario in which Irma makes landfall along the Gulf coast as a category 5 storm would probably be the worst of all potential possibilities.\n\nIf such a scenario plays out, please get out of the path of this storm. Trying to \u201cride this storm out\u201d would do you no good whatsoever.\n\nMichael Snyder is a Republican candidate for Congress in Idaho\u2019s First Congressional District, and you can learn how you can get involved in the campaign on his official website.
