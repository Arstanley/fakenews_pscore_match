She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018\n\nTrump, of course, lied about what Rep. Waters called for which was peaceful protests and public demonstrations rather than the \u201charm\u201d he claims. The \u201cBe careful what you wish for Max!\u201d quote, however, was a dog whistle call to action for his supporters to attack Rep. Waters on par with his warning during his campaign when discussing Hillary Clinton that perhaps \u201cthe Second Amendment people\u201d i.e., gun owners could solve the problem.\n\nWhile some people may consider Trump\u2019s tweet as more cheap theatrics for his base, the president\u2019s hate-mongering towards Waters has real-life consequences as the news about a San Pedro, California man demonstrates.\n\nAnthony Scott Lloyd, 45, is pled guilty on April 16th to a charge of threatening to kill Rep. Maxine Waters because of her criticism of President Trump.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Lloyd \u201cfaces a single count of threatening a United States official, according to a plea agreement filed March 26. It is punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\u201d\n\nLloyd\u2019s plea details the voicemail that he left at Congresswoman Waters\u2019 Washington DC office last October that used both a racial slur and an anti-gay epithet to refer to the representative and stated that:\n\n\u201cIf you continue to make threats towards the president, you\u2019re going to wind up dead, Maxine, \u2019cause we\u2019ll kill you.\u201c\n\nThe voicemail was forwarded to the FBI who investigated it and arrested Lloyd who claims that the call was a \u201cspur of the moment\u201d decision made while listening to conservative talk radio and that he had no real intention of following through with the threat.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no such assurances from the president himself, and given Trump\u2019s penchant for simply ignoring the rule of law, that is a frightening proposition.\n\nThe contrast here is stark between Trump and Waters and the other Democrats whose calls for peaceful activism through public declarations of disgust and shaming of deplorable policies and behaviors are met by Trump and his Republican enablers with threats laden with hints of violence.\n\nWhen those threats lead deranged Trump supporters to take action beyond mere threatening phone calls, the responsibility for incitement to violence will be squarely at Trump\u2019s feet.\n\nCorrection: The original headline to this story erroneously implied that Anthony Scott Lloyd, the man who threatened Rep. Waters, did so on the same day as President Trump\u2019s tweet about the Congresswoman on June 25th. An editing error also caused the timing of the guilty plea to be reported as happening that same day, even though it actually took place over two months prior to Trump\u2019s June 25th tweet. The story has been revised to reflect the actual chronology of the events. Washington Press greatly regrets the errors.\n\nPresident Trump has sent tweets criticizing Rep. Waters prior to the tweet on June 25th, including this one from March prior to Mr. Lloyd\u2019s plea. Therefore the conclusion that Trump\u2019s bullying tactics have dangerous real life consequences remains valid.\n\nJoin millions calling for AG Barr to resign after he defied his constitutional obligations to protect Trump!", "images": ["https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/washington-press-newicon2x.jpg", "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/trumo-conway-tweet-2-20x15.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/f8ae116403fba8aabe348c6c184c9daa?s=164&d=mm&r=g", "https://washingtonpress.com/native/image/?/content/images/15759630881142623225.jpg&static=true&pos=face&h=315&w=420&fmt=jpeg", "https://washingtonpress.com/native/image/?/content/images/15684011750970738967.jpg&static=true&pos=face&h=315&w=420&fmt=jpeg", "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/donald-trump-melania-tweet-2-20x15.jpg", "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/washington-press-newlogo2x.jpg", "https://washingtonpress.com/native/image/?/content/images/15514392841141082368.jpg&static=true&pos=face&h=315&w=420&fmt=jpeg", "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/90-12-20x15.jpeg", "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/maxine-and-don.jpg"], "top_img": "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/maxine-and-don.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Download Our New App Free", "Vinnie Longobardo"], "canonical_link": "https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/25/a-trump-fan-was-just-charged-with-trying-to-murder-maxine-waters-on-same-day-trump-threatened-her-3/", "title": "Correction: A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radio", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-washington-press-newicon2x-270x270.jpg", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Correction: A Trump fan was charged with threathening to murder Maxine Waters after listening to right wing radio", "description": "The president's threats against the beloved Democratic Representative have real consequences.", "image": "https://washingtonpress.com/wp-content/uploads/maxine-and-don.jpg", "url": "https://washingtonpress.com/2018/06/25/a-trump-fan-was-just-charged-with-trying-to-murder-maxine-waters-on-same-day-trump-threatened-her-3/", "site_name": "Washington Press", "updated_time": "2018-07-24T12:12:14-04:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtondcpress/", "published_time": "2018-06-25T16:28:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-24T12:12:14-04:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.3.2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1274410752", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.OccupyDemocrats.android", "author": "Download our new app FREE", "fb": {"app_id": 1921221324799355, "admins": 100010978633754, "pages": 1554747021224321}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529856000.0, "source": "https://washingtonpress.com", "summary": ""}
