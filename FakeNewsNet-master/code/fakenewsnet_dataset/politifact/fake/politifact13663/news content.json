The president says that his legacy \u201cshould not be diminished,\u201d and that this is the only way he can \u201ckeep an eye\u201d over Trump, as well as future presidents.\n\n\u201cI have been president for only eight years, and in that time, I have done what no other presidents could do in all their time in total,\u201d said Obama. \u201cI have created a legacy that should not be diminished. I have created something that no future president will be able to do. In that regard, I have commissioned this statute, with plans to have it permanently erected in the entryway of the White House, so that all who enter can remember me fondly.\u201d\n\nThe statue will not be allowed to be removed, as every president is allowed to leave one thing in the White House that must never be touched by future presidents. William Howard Taft left his giant bathtub. Bill Clinton left one of his saxophones. George W. Bush left a piece of mirror and a rolled up hundred.\n\n0\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "images": ["https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/logo.png", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/themes/empire-news/images/arrow-nxt.png", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hacker-150x150.jpg", "http://empiresports.co/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/AD-Square-01.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/obama-1024x768.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/twitter.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/themes/empire-news/images/arrow-pre.png", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/linkedin.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/facebook.jpg", "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/uber-150x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/obama-1024x768.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bob The Empire News Potato"], "canonical_link": "https://empirenews.net/obama-orders-life-sized-bronze-statute-of-himself-to-be-permanently-installed-in-white-house/", "title": "Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statute of Himself To Be Permanently Installed in White House", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "shareaholic": {"site_name": "Empire News", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://empirenews.net/obama-orders-life-sized-bronze-statute-of-himself-to-be-permanently-installed-in-white-house/", "keywords": "obama, statue, politics, post", "article_published_time": "2016-12-31T14:39:09+00:00", "article_modified_time": "2016-12-31T14:39:09+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_author_name": "Bob The Empire News Potato", "site_id": "76243683f49863b3ff8e5df0254b974d", "wp_version": "8.13.10", "image": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/obama-300x225.jpg"}, "og": {"image": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/obama-1024x768.jpg", "title": "Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statute of Himself To Be Permanently Installed in White House"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.13", "fb": {"app_id": 227412004135680}, "ca_title": "Obama Orders Life-Sized Bronze Statute of Himself To Be Permanently Installed in White House", "ca_image": "https://empirenews.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/obama-150x150.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://empirenews.net", "summary": ""}
