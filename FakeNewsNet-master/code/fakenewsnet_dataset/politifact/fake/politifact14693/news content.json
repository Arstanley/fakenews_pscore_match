You can read about the new breaking indictment at this link. Our original explainer on the hackings, written before the new indictment, is below.\n\nOriginal post: There\u2019s one positively enormous shoe that still hasn\u2019t dropped in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign: an indictment about all those hacked emails.\n\nThe hacking and release of leading political figures\u2019 emails is the most visible election intervention attributed to Russia\u2019s government. And it\u2019s long been one of the leading, and perhaps the leading, possibility about just what \u201ccollusion\u201d between Donald Trump\u2019s team and the Russians might have involved.\n\nThat\u2019s not mere speculation. We\u2019ve gradually learned of not one but six times Trump associates at least tried to get involved with either Russian-provided dirt, hacked Democratic emails, or WikiLeaks. We don\u2019t yet know whether these furtive contacts resulted in anything of significance \u2014 but one of these advisers, George Papadopoulos, has already pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the matter and has begun cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team.\n\nThese hacks were crimes, victimizing many hundreds of Americans (those who had their documents stolen, and those who corresponded with them). The operation was more wide-ranging than many remember, targeting not just John Podesta and the DNC but many other people and groups. It wasn\u2019t just emails stolen, either \u2014 posted material ranged from Democratic Party turnout data that a Republican operative thought was \u201cprobably worth millions of dollars\u201d to even a purported picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport.\n\nNo charges have been filed in the matter \u2014 yet. But some are likely coming. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the US has identified \u201cmore than six members of the Russian government\u201d involved in the DNC hacks. And the Daily Beast wrote that investigators have identified a specific Russian intelligence officer behind \u201cGuccifer 2.0,\u201d a leading figure in the hacks. Mueller is now overseeing the probe.\n\nTo understand what happened in 2016, we have to understand the hackings. And though some mysteries remain, much of the complex story has gradually been pieced together by journalists and cybersecurity experts. The consequences, of course, unfolded in plain sight during the campaign itself.\n\nHow the hacks happened (a phishing expedition)\n\nThe media often shorthands the 2016 hack story as: Russians hacked Podesta and the DNC\u2019s email accounts, and WikiLeaks then posted those hacked emails publicly.\n\nThe full story is more complex. Let\u2019s start at the beginning.\n\nBetween March 2015 and May 2016, a group of hackers went on a phishing expedition. The \u201cbaited lines\u201d they cast out were at least 19,000 malicious emails that resembled the one below:\n\nThese emails were designed to look as if they were coming from Google. But they were in fact designed to trick people into clicking through and entering their login credentials \u2014 delivering them right into the hackers\u2019 hands.\n\nAccording to a later Associated Press analysis of a report by the information security firm SecureWorks, at least 573 of the more than 4,700 email addresses targeted were American. They included many US government officials, military officials, intelligence officials, and defense contractors.\n\nParticularly beginning in March and April 2016, these targets began to include many Democrats as well. Per the AP, more than 130 Democratic accounts were sent these malicious links, compared to just \u201ca handful\u201d of Republican accounts. Podesta and several Clinton staffers \u2014 along with former Secretary of State Colin Powell, retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, and others \u2014 had their accounts successfully compromised. (We know all this because the hackers used the link-shortening tool Bitly to do their work and accidentally left their activity publicly viewable.)\n\nRussia was eventually blamed for the phishing expedition, for several reasons. For one, SecureWorks concluded the particular malware used in this campaign was tied to a hacking group that outside researchers had been tracking for some time \u2014 a group they thought to be linked the GRU, Russia\u2019s foreign military intelligence agency. We don\u2019t know what the secretive hacking group calls itself, but various cybersecurity researchers had given it several names: Iron Twilight, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) 28, Pawn Storm, and \u2014 most famously \u2014 \u201cFancy Bear.\u201d\n\nCircumstantial evidence also suggests a Russian-tied culprit. For instance, the phishers were extremely focused on Ukraine \u2014 at least 545 targeted email accounts were from there, comparable to the number of American targets. These included Ukraine\u2019s president and many other top government officials, who are hostile to Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime.\n\nThe Russians targeted, meanwhile, were generally critics of Putin\u2019s government and journalists. Another interesting detail, per the AP, is that more than 95 percent of the malicious links were created between the hours of 9 am and 6 pm, Monday to Friday \u2014 Moscow time.\n\nAround April 2016, as this phishing campaign increasingly began to target Democrats, material was also taken from the DNC. The firm Crowdstrike attributed this as a hack from Fancy Bear, citing the malware used, and other firms agreed with this assessment. These firms also concluded that a separate group of Russian-tied hackers (dubbed \u201cCozy Bear\u201d) had been in the DNC\u2019s systems for much longer, since all the way back in the summer of 2015.\n\nThe precise mechanisms of how the DNC was breached remain somewhat murky. But Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign did send out malicious links to nine DNC email accounts in March and April 2016. And as we\u2019ll soon see, hacked DNC material ended up in the same place as hacked material from Podesta and others. A January 2017 US intelligence report would later specifically blame Russia\u2019s GRU \u2014 the agency thought to be behind Fancy Bear \u2014 for taking \u201clarge volumes of data from the DNC.\u201d\n\nAs striking as all this may seem, though, government-backed hacking is far from unusual. The US does it. Our allies do it. Our rivals do it. China was said to have hacked Barack Obama and John McCain\u2019s presidential campaigns in 2008 and was then tied to a massive theft of federal data in 2015. Foreign intelligence agencies trying to peek into political activities seemed to be something that just, well, happened all the time.\n\nWhat came next in 2016, however, was a jarring departure from these norms \u2014 the hacked information began to be posted publicly, in massive amounts.\n\nA timeline of odd events between the hacks and the leaks\n\nThe backdrop to all of this was the US presidential election \u2014 the first series of primaries and caucuses took place in February and early March. The surprisingly Russia-friendly Donald Trump emerged as the clear leader in the Republican contest, over his Putin-critical rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, with whom Putin\u2019s regime had long had chilly relations, emerged as the favorite for the Democratic nomination over Bernie Sanders.\n\nIt was around this point \u2014 in mid-March 2016 \u2014 that the phishing campaign began to particularly target many Democrats\u2019 and Clinton campaign staffers\u2019 email accounts, according to SecureWorks\u2019 analysis.\n\nThere were several other events that, in retrospect, are either relevant or at the very least intriguing:\n\nApril 7: Putin condemns the Panama Papers leak . In early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth \u2014 the Panama Papers. Many of the documents revealed financial information about Putin\u2019s inner circle, and Putin publicly claimed the stories were part of a US plot against Russia. \u201cThey are trying to destabilize us from within in order to make us more compliant,\u201d he said. Many have posited that the Russian government may have then wished to retaliate.\n\nIn early April, an international consortium of journalists published reports on a cache of leaked documents tracing offshore wealth \u2014 the Panama Papers.

For now, nothing is posted. (US intelligence agencies have said Russia\u2019s GRU is behind the site.)\n\n. For now, nothing is posted. (US intelligence agencies have said Russia\u2019s GRU is behind the site.) April 26: George Papadopoulos g e t s an intriguing tip . Papadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, sat down in London with a professor named Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud told him he\u2019d just traveled to Moscow and met high-level Russian government officials. He added to Papadopoulos that Russia had obtained \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton, in the form of thousands of emails.\n\nPapadopoulos, a young foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign, sat down in London with a professor named Joseph Mifsud.

DCLeaks\u2019 posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties. That\u2019s because they included the hacked emails of retired Gen. Philip Breedlove, who had commanded NATO forces in Europe and pushed for a harder line against Russia in Ukraine. They also included documents from George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundation. (The Russian government has blamed Soros and his associated groups for opposing its interests in Ukraine.)\n\nDCLeaks\u2019 posts of hacked documents indicated that it was Russian ties.

June 9: The Trump Tower meeting: Shortly afterward, Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner met a Russian lawyer and four other people with Russian ties at Trump Tower. Don Jr. had agreed to take the meeting based on the promise of \u201cofficial documents and information that would incriminate Hillary,\u201d as part of \u201cRussia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump\u201d (as it was put to him in an email). Everyone involved claims nothing came of this meeting.\n\nThroughout all this time, there was no public indication that the phishing campaign, or the hacking of the DNC and other campaign figures\u2019 emails, had taken place. Just days later, that would change.\n\nThe email leaks begin\n\nOn June 12, 2016, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange dropped a bombshell. \u201cWe have upcoming leaks in relation to Hillary Clinton,\u201d he announced, during a British television interview. \u201cWe have emails pending publication.\u201d\n\nWikiLeaks \u2014 a nonprofit launched back in 2006 by Assange, an Australian activist \u2014 had previously been most famous for posting a plethora of internal US military documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars (including video of a deadly airstrike) and more than 250,000 diplomatic cables from the US State Department \u2014 leaked by Chelsea Manning. Assange was then accused of rape and sexual assault in Sweden, and he sought political asylum from Ecuador. He has been holed up in the nation\u2019s London embassy since June 2012.\n\nAssange\u2019s announcement was the first public indication that Democrats would soon be plagued by leaked internal emails. So two days after that, the DNC, which had learned of the hacking of its systems and hired Crowdstrike to respond, decided to get in front of what it feared was coming. The committee told the Washington Post that it had been hacked \u2014 by, it claimed, the Russian government. Crowdstrike\u2019s CEO put up a blog post explaining why he identified Russia as the culprit.\n\nYet the next day, June 15, things got even weirder \u2014 because that is when \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d arrived on the scene. (The name, a portmanteau of \u201cGucci\u201d and \u201cLucifer,\u201d is an homage to the original Guccifer, the jailed Romanian hacker Marcel Leher Lazar, who\u2019d broken into high-profile Americans\u2019 email accounts.)\n\nIn a Wordpress post, the new Guccifer said that Crowdstrike was quite wrong about the DNC hack, which he said was carried out by him, \u201ca lone hacker.\u201d (\u201cFuck CrowdStrike!!!\u201d he wrote.) He said that he\u2019d given \u201cthe main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails\u201d that he\u2019d stolen, to WikiLeaks. (WikiLeaks has refused to confirm that he was its source.) He also began to post several documents he claimed were from the DNC server.\n\nAlmost immediately, journalists pointed to inconsistencies in Guccifer\u2019s story and linguistic tics to suggest he was Russian \u2014 or more than one Russian. (US intelligence agencies would eventually say Russia\u2019s GRU was behind the persona, and the Daily Beast recently reported that the account\u2019s user once slipped up and neglected to mask his identity through a VPN \u2014 allowing investigators to match a particular Russian intelligence officer to that Guccifer 2.0 login.)\n\nYet what Guccifer had access to was clearly broader than just the DNC. None of the first documents he posted showed up in WikiLeaks\u2019 DNC email dump, and in fact, many of them eventually showed up in John Podesta\u2019s emails, which were released much later. Additionally, on June 27, Guccifer emailed the Smoking Gun\u2019s William Bastone a link to a password-protected post on DCLeaks.com that contained phished emails and documents from Clinton staffer Sarah Hamilton. (DCLeaks had not yet publicly posted any material related to the election.)\n\nOn July 6, Guccifer 2.0 posted his first documents that would eventually be found in the DNC emails. The New Yorker\u2019s Raffi Khatchadourian speculates, based on some comments Guccifer made to journalists at the time, that Guccifer or his handlers were frustrated that WikiLeaks was taking too long to actually post the DNC material and were threatening to spoil Assange\u2019s exclusive. (A week later, Guccifer would send documents to the Hill\u2019s Joe Uchill, writing that he was doing so because the press was \u201cgradually forget[ing] about me,\u201d and complained that WikiLeaks was \u201cplaying for time.\u201d)\n\nAll the while, Assange and WikiLeaks were working to prepare their database of DNC emails, with the apparent goal of publishing them before the Democratic convention began in late July. It\u2019s unclear how they set that goal. Assange would later tell Khatchadourian that he originally had a deadline of July 18 to release them, but \u201cwe were given a little more time.\u201d (It\u2019s unclear, though, who gave him more time, and Assange later disputed the accuracy of the recorded quote.)\n\nFinally, on July 22 \u2014 the Friday before the convention \u2014 WikiLeaks posted those thousands of DNC emails and attachments online. They revealed that many DNC members privately spoke of Bernie Sanders with disdain, drove DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other top staffers to resign, and overall made an ugly start for the Democratic convention. Though Assange remained mum on his source, Guccifer 2.0 jubilantly claimed credit in a tweet:\n\nThe DNC leaks proved to be just the beginning. News soon broke that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) had also been hacked, and on August 12, DCCC documents started showing up on Guccifer\u2019s Wordpress site. Guccifer also sent the DCCC\u2019s internal turnout model data to Florida Republican Party operative Aaron Nevins, who was positively thrilled to receive it. \u201cHoly fuck man I don\u2019t think you realize what you gave me,\u201d Nevins wrote in a DM. \u201cThis is probably worth millions of dollars.\u201d Nevins soon put it online on his anonymously run blog.\n\nThen DCLeaks got in the game. On August 12, the site posted a few emails from some little-known Republican state party aides, and from campaign advisers to Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC), both of whom were known as Russia hawks. In September, the site\u2019s anonymous administrators sent Colin Powell\u2019s phished emails to reporters, revealing his candid assessments of both Clinton (\u201cgreedy\u201d) and Trump (\u201cnational disgrace\u201d).\n\nDCLeaks then posted phished emails from Ian Mellul, an Obama White House staffer who had volunteered for Clinton. The Mellul documents included a picture of Michelle Obama\u2019s passport and a months-old audio file in which Hillary Clinton said Sanders\u2019s young supporters were \u201cliving in their parents\u2019 basement.\u201d Longtime Clinton ally Capricia Marshall\u2019s phished emails came next.\n\nMany of these disclosures caused brief stirs, but what everyone was really waiting for was the next WikiLeaks dump. Roger Stone, the Trump associate, claimed that he knew Assange had something huge on the way and speculated it would involve the Clinton Foundation.\n\nAssange himself told Fox News back on August 24 that his team had \u201cthousands of pages of material\u201d and was \u201cworking around the clock\u201d to prepare it for publication. By early October, there was still nothing from WikiLeaks, but Stone continued to hype an imminent release, saying \u201can intermediary\u201d who\u2019d met with Assange said \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cmother lode\u201d instead came two days later, on Friday, October 7, when WikiLeaks posted its first batch of Podesta\u2019s emails. The site would continue to post them, in batches, up through the election. Earlier on that very same day, the US government officially attributed the hacking effort to the Russian government, and the Donald Trump Access Hollywood tape hit the news.\n\nIn the end, the 2016 election was close, decided by just over 1 percentage point in three Electoral College states. And whether or not the email leaks were sufficient to swing the outcome, they certainly were effective at keeping the words \u201cHillary Clinton\u201d and \u201cemails\u201d in the headlines throughout the campaign\u2019s final stretch.\n\nTrump associates tried to get in touch with hackers or leakers at least six separate times\n\nDuring the campaign, it was clear enough that Trump was unusually friendly to Russia, and that the Russian government interventions seemed aimed at trying to help his electoral chances at the expense of Hillary Clinton. But after the election, more and more attention became devoted to whether Trump associates and Putin\u2019s government coordinated to intervene in the campaign in some way. And on March 20, 2017, then-FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed the FBI was investigating just that topic.\n\nNo one has produced a smoking gun demonstrating clear involvement just yet. But this isn\u2019t mere idle speculation, either \u2014 there are at least six instances in which Trump associates tried to get Russian dirt or communicated with hacking and leaking figures. The first of them was what initiated the FBI investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia to begin with:\n\n1) The Papadopoulos tip: Fancy Bear\u2019s phishing campaign targeted Clinton staffers and Democrats in large numbers in March and April 2016, but the hacks remained publicly unknown for months afterward. Yet it was very early indeed \u2014 on April 26 \u2014 that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos got his tip about what was coming.\n\nAs described above, the tip was from a source Papadopoulos understood to have Russian government connections, professor Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud specifically said he\u2019d gained his information from traveling to Moscow and meeting high-level officials there. And he said Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton \u2014 and, specifically, thousands of emails.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know whether he told others in the Trump campaign about what he\u2019d heard. But it seems highly likely that he did. He was a young adviser eager to impress campaign higher-ups. And we already know he drunkenly bragged about his inside info to an Australian diplomat a few weeks later. (The Australians later told the FBI, which led the bureau to open the investigation.)\n\nIn any case, Papadopoulos was arrested last summer for making false statements to FBI investigators, cut a plea deal, and began cooperating with investigators. So whatever he did do with his tip, Mueller likely now knows it.\n\n2) The Trump Tower meeting: It was on June 3, 2016 \u2014 a little more than a month after Papadopoulos\u2019s tip, but still before any news broke about Democrats having been hacked \u2014 that publicist Rob Goldstone emailed an acquaintance of his, Donald Trump Jr. Goldstone described some news from his clients Aras and Emin Agalarov, a father-son pair of real estate developers who\u2019d done business with the Trumps:\n\nThe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father. This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.\n\nDon Jr. enthusiastically accepted the offer, and Goldstone arranged a meeting six days later, on June 9. The Trump delegation included Don Jr., Paul Manafort, and Jared Kushner. They met Goldstone, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, Agalarov company executive Ike Kaveladze, Russian-American lobbyist Rinat Akhmetshin, and translator Anatoli Samochornov.\n\nOnce the existence of the meeting became public, all parties involved claimed it was a dud, resulting in nothing of consequence. But the timing of the meeting is strange. Three days later, Assange announced he\u2019d received emails related to Hillary Clinton. Two days after that, the DNC announced it had been hacked and blamed Russia.\n\nGoldstone saw an article about that and emailed it to Emin and Kaveladze, writing that the news was \u201ceerily weird\u201d considering what they\u2019d just discussed at the Trump Tower meeting. Guccifer 2.0 began posting the day after that.\n\n3) The Cambridge Analytica CEO\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Cambridge Analytica is the Steve Bannon-tied firm that did digital work for the Trump campaign and has been in the news of late.\n\nAnd last year, we learned that Cambridge\u2019s CEO, Alexander Nix, had twice contacted WikiLeaks on the topic of hacked emails.\n\nNix says that in \u201cearly June,\u201d after he learned of Assange\u2019s claims to have Hillary Clinton-related emails, he reached out to Julian Assange to ask for an advance look at those emails. He says Assange turned him down.\n\nThen in August, after Assange had posted the DNC emails, Nix emailed Cambridge employees to say that he\u2019d recently reached out to Assange again, offering help at organizing the DNC material on WikiLeaks. He said he hadn\u2019t yet heard back. Both Nix and Assange have said these overtures didn\u2019t go anywhere.\n\n4) Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s contacts with WikiLeaks: Then, separately, Donald Trump Jr. had some communications with WikiLeaks through the group\u2019s Twitter account toward the end of the campaign.\n\nAs best we know, WikiLeaks began the communication, DMing Don Jr. to tell him that they had guessed the password to a new \u201cPAC run anti-Trump site,\u201d PutinTrump.org, that was about to launch. \u201cAny comments?\u201d the group asked. Trump Jr. answered: \u201cOff the record I don\u2019t know who that is but I\u2019ll ask around. Thanks.\u201d\n\nThen on October 3, 2016, WikiLeaks DMed Don Jr. again, asking him to \u201ccomment on\u201d or \u201cpush\u201d a story that Hillary Clinton had once said she wanted to \u201cjust drone\u201d Assange. Don Jr. answered, \u201cAlready did that earlier today. It\u2019s amazing what she can get away with.\u201d\n\nHe then followed up with a question: \u201cWhat\u2019s behind this Wednesday leak I keep reading about?\u201d This was at the height of chatter that WikiLeaks had a major batch of anti-Clinton material ready. However, there is no indication that WikiLeaks answered this question from Don Jr. or gave him any advance information that it was Podesta\u2019s emails that were coming. The group sent him a couple more messages, but there are no more known responses from Don Jr.\n\n5) Roger Stone\u2019s several contacts with both Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks: Roger Stone is a longtime Republican operative with a reputation for dirty tricks and a decades-long relationship with Donald Trump. Stone was only an official Trump campaign adviser briefly, departing the operation in early August 2015 after clashing with other staffers. But he remained in Trump\u2019s orbit and, to some extent, in communication with the candidate himself afterward.\n\nBoth in public and in private, Stone was fixated on the hackings and leaks.\n\nOne associate of Stone\u2019s claimed to the Washington Post that at some point in the spring of 2016, before news of the hackings broke, Stone said he\u2019d learned from Julian Assange that WikiLeaks had obtained emails that would hurt Democrats. (Stone denies this.)\n\nThe initial leaks from Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks were posted in June and July. On August 4, Stone emailed fellow ex-Trump adviser and longtime associate Sam Nunberg: \u201cI dined with Julian Assange last night,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. (Stone says this was a joke and flight records prove he wasn\u2019t in London then.)\n\nThe day after that email, on August 5, Stone penned a Breitbart article in which he took Guccifer\u2019s story about being a lone hacker who stole the DNC emails at face value and argued Russia probably wasn\u2019t responsible. He also tweeted that \u201cJulian Assange is a hero.\u201d\n\nThree days later, on August 8, Stone started publicly claiming to have inside information. \u201cI actually have communicated with Assange,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the next tranche of his documents pertain to the Clinton Foundation but there\u2019s no telling what the October surprise may be.\u201d\n\nA few days after that, Stone began tweeting at, and eventually DMing with, Guccifer 2.0 (who, again, has reportedly been identified as a Russian intelligence officer). Some of these DMs later leaked, leading Stone to post what he claimed was their full exchange. The posted messages are mainly friendly chitchat and not particularly substantive.\n\nOn August 21, Stone tweeted an odd prediction: \u201cTrust me, it will soon the Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel. #CrookedHillary.\u201d Many would later point to this \u2014 which came months before the Podesta emails became public \u2014 and ask whether Stone had advance knowledge of the Podesta email leak. (Stone himself would later claim that since this came in the midst of a scandal surrounding Stone\u2019s old friend Paul Manafort\u2019s Ukraine work, he was merely predicting \u201cPodesta\u2019s business dealings would be exposed.\u201d)\n\nAs October began, Stone took on a new role \u2014 as WikiLeaks\u2019 hype man. He again claimed inside knowledge, saying a \u201cfriend\u201d of his met with Assange and learned \u201cthe mother lode is coming Wednesday.\u201d He tweeted: \u201cWednesday @HillaryClinton is done. #Wikileaks.\u201d And when nothing came on Wednesday, Stone tweeted, \u201cLibs thinking Assange will stand down are wishful thinking. Payload coming. #Lockthemup.\u201d Assange published the Podesta emails two days later.\n\nImmediately, there were questions about whether the garrulous operative had been involved, which eventually spurred WikiLeaks to tweet that the group \u201chas never communicated with Roger Stone.\u201d The Atlantic later reported that Stone DMed the WikiLeaks Twitter account afterward, complaining that they were \u201cattacking\u201d him. \u201cThe false claims of association are being used by the democrats to undermine the impact of our publications,\u201d WikiLeaks responded. \u201cDon\u2019t go there if you don\u2019t want us to correct you.\u201d Stone shot back: \u201cHa! The more you \u2018correct\u2019 me the more people think you\u2019re lying. Your operation leaks like a sieve. You need to figure out who your friends are.\u201d\n\nWhat to make of all this? Stone was obviously in contact with two of the key leakers, and his own public statements show that at one point he wanted people to think he had an inside line on WikiLeaks\u2019 plans. However, he\u2019s repeatedly denied any inside knowledge or involvement, and we haven\u2019t seen any clear evidence that he truly had such knowledge.\n\nIn any case, we might learn more from Mueller\u2019s probe soon enough. \u201cThey want me to testify against Roger,\u201d Sam Nunberg said this year, referring to the special counsel\u2019s team. \u201cThey want me to say that Roger was going around telling people he was colluding with Julian Assange.\u201d\n\n6) Peter Smith\u2019s hunt for Hillary\u2019s deleted emails: Last but certainly not least, there is one more email-related subplot to the 2016 campaign \u2014 and it\u2019s a weird one.\n\nThis one involves a separate set of emails: When word got out that Hillary Clinton had used a personal email account for all her work at the State Department, she agreed to hand over the work-related emails on that account to government investigators. But it turned out that she had previously deemed about 32,000 emails (about half of the total) to be \u201cpersonal\u201d rather than work-related, and deleted them.\n\nConservatives like longtime Republican operative Peter Smith didn\u2019t take Clinton\u2019s explanation for why she deleted the emails at face value and questioned whether they could have contained scandalous behavior or criminal evidence. Their number included GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 [Hillary Clinton] emails that are missing,\u201d Trump said at a July 27, 2016, press conference. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let\u2019s see if that happens. That will be next.\u201d\n\nIt was around this time that Smith began an unusual project. He assumed that Clinton\u2019s email server had been hacked and that her emails must be out there somewhere, on the \u201cdark web.\u201d So he reached out to computer experts and conservative activists, hoping to assemble a team that would track down those emails.\n\nSmith didn\u2019t work for the Trump campaign. But he is said to have repeatedly claimed to be in contact with Michael Flynn, who was advising Trump. One recruiting document Smith sent to cybersecurity expert Matt Tait contained the subheader \u201cTrump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure).\u201d It then listed several names: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Flynn, and Lisa Nelson. (Bannon and Conway have denied any involvement. The other three haven\u2019t commented.)\n\nEventually, Smith gave his version of what happened to the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Shane Harris. He said his team found five hacker groups who said they had Clinton\u2019s emails, of which two seemed to be Russian. \u201cWe knew the people who had these were probably around the Russian government,\u201d Smith said. However, he went on, he couldn\u2019t determine whether the emails were authentic, so he ended up just advising the hackers to give them to WikiLeaks. No such emails have ever surfaced. Smith \u2014 81 years old and in poor health \u2014 killed himself in May 2017, 10 days after speaking to Harris.\n\nSmith\u2019s effort appears to have failed. But Smith admitted he had tried to get stolen documents from groups he understood to be Russian government-tied. And then there is the question of Michael Flynn\u2019s role \u2014 particularly since, per Harris\u2019s sources, there are intelligence reports that say Russian hackers discussed how they could get leaked emails into Flynn\u2019s hands. Much remains murky about this situation, but Flynn is cooperating with Mueller\u2019s team as part of a plea deal, so the special counsel likely now knows whatever he does.\n\nMueller will likely bring charges in the email hacking matter. But against whom?\n\nLast November, the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Aruna Viswanatha and Del Quentin Wilber reported that the Justice Department had identified more than six Russian government officials involved in the DNC hack and was considering bringing charges.\n\nInterestingly, though, the report claimed that special counsel Robert Mueller had chosen not to take over the DNC hack investigation because it was \u201crelatively technical\u201d and had already \u201cbeen under way for nearly a year.\u201d\n\nThat appears to have since changed. Both NBC News and the Daily Beast reported in March that Mueller had now taken charge of the email hacking investigation. And the Washington Post reported in January that Mueller had added \u201ca veteran cyber prosecutor,\u201d Ryan Dickey, to his team. (Credit to Marcy Wheeler for flagging this point.)\n\nSo it\u2019s a pretty safe bet that Mueller will bring some charges related to the email hackings. And judging by his past indictments, he\u2019ll also use them to tell a story about what exactly happened, to the extent he can. There is, after all, a good deal we still don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how, exactly, did the DNC and Podesta emails get from the hackers to WikiLeaks?\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that this is all just what we know about \u2014 there could be more that is still not public. It is certainly possible that several of their contacts with real or purported leakers and hackers listed above went nowhere, but it\u2019s a bit harder to believe that all six of those separate contacts resulted in nothing of consequence.\n\nMueller has already gotten three people tied to Trump to plead guilty and cooperate with the investigation. What is he getting from George Papadopoulos, who got the earliest known tip that the Russians hacked the emails? What is he getting from Michael Flynn, who may have been tied to Peter Smith\u2019s effort to get Clinton emails from Russian hackers? What was he getting from Rick Gates, who was Paul Manafort\u2019s right-hand man both before and during the campaign?\n\nAll three men have pleaded guilty, and we haven\u2019t seen any of the fruits of their cooperation yet. They may be providing Mueller information about the hacked emails, and they may not. But it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re telling Mueller a good deal that\u2019s of interest \u2014 and eventually, we will find out what.", "images":
